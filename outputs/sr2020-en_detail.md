# Message from the President and CEO

Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (“ThaiBev”) is committed to becoming a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader, and has resolved to emerge “Stronger than Ever” from the unprecedented COVID-19 global pandemic. This commitment has inspired our efforts throughout the unexpected challenges of the past year and will lead us to continued sustainable success.

Vision 2020, which emphasizes the 5 pillars of Growth, Diversity, Brands, Reach, and Professionalism, has propelled us to become a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader. We are proud to say that ThaiBev has grown from a Thai company to become a regional leader, with a diversified revenue stream and product portfolio, and group synergy.

ThaiBev is embarking on the next evolution of the company through a business transformation program known as PASSION 2025, which will propel the entire organization for the first half of the next decade. Through PASSION 2025, ThaiBev is determined to accelerate on building new businesses, strengthen our competitive advantages, unlock value of our potentials, and continue to pursue our sustainability mission of “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth” with our stakeholders.

ThaiBev is inspired by our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (“SEP”), and our effort is guided by His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua first royal command that His Majesty is determined to preserve, sustain, and enhance this legacy. The United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) have also contributed to framing our goals. The SEP principles and the SDG targets have enabled us to take meaningful actions to help address the world’s most pressing environmental, social, and economic challenges as outlined by the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the strategic level, ThaiBev has started harnessing our own potentials to develop business solutions that enhance our positive contribution to the SDGs.

The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has inspired us to build new capabilities to maintain our business operation by launching ThaiBev Situation Room (TSR) to ensure employee wellbeing, business continuity, and maintain supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscored the importance of having robust digital platforms and systems, in terms of employee, customer and partner interfaces, capabilities that ThaiBev will continue to improve. The public health crisis has also led ThaiBev to examine more closely on the issue of resource scarcity and the importance of business agility. ThaiBev thus established Prolab Vibhavadi Medical Technology Clinic for COVID-19 testing to provide medical services to employees and the public. By adjusting to any circumstances speedily, ThaiBev will not only be able to retain our business accomplishment, but also be better positioned to uphold our long-stated mission.

ThaiBev has remained steadfast in sustaining our environmental and social commitments. Climate change remains an important battle, connected to various issues the world faces recently. ThaiBev continues investing in renewable energy and contribute to bolster the welfare and income of local communities. This is achieved through contributions to education, public health, sports, art and culture, and community development – all areas ThaiBev engages in. ThaiBev partnered with another DJSI Industry Leader to mass produce and distribute alcohol sanitizer to hospitals and local communities throughout Thailand. These collaborative efforts will increase as ThaiBev honors our membership and pledges to the UN Global Compact.

Furthermore, ThaiBev looked toward cross-industry collaborations, pursuing SDG 17: “Partnerships for the Goals” to assist the larger community. The initiation of Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) by ThaiBev and our network to extend support for business partners that are small and medium enterprises (SME). In 2020, ThaiBev initiated and organized Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) 2020, marking the milestone for one of the most significant cooperation between leading companies in Thailand. Many enthusiastic activities had introduced and inspired Thailand sustainability shapers to continue on the path towards national and global sustainability.

I wish to personally thank all of our passionate employees for their hard work for ThaiBev over the year. They carried on with enthusiasm, resourcefulness and perseverance, and through the collective efforts of all employees, our partners and all our stakeholders, ThaiBev has indeed emerged Stronger than Ever.

**Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi**  
President and CEO

The Sustainability Development Working Team (SDWT), consisting of representatives from various business groups and divisions, is responsible for developing plans and sustainable development projects as well as participating in corporate sustainability assessments that verify the comprehensiveness of material sustainability topics. The SDWT also monitors and reports the progress of sustainable development programs to the CSDC and SRMC.


ThaiBev has participated in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) Corporate Sustainability Assessment for 6 consecutive years. In 2020, ThaiBev was selected as DJSI Emerging Market and DJSI World Indices for fifth and fourth consecutive years, respectively. ThaiBev is the first Asian company to be selected as a sustainability leader in the beverage industry for third consecutive years. This remarkable achievement reflects ThaiBev’s commitment in sustainable development.

ThaiBev gives priority to the environment issues given that environmental conditions impact communities and quality of lives, which consequently affect the company’s operations. If the environment is well maintained, communities and society as a whole and businesses can thrive. Thus, environment, communities, society must be co-exist and support each other.

In 2020, ThaiBev initiated and collaborated with other DJSI industry leaders in Thailand to drive sustainable development by organizing the first Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) 2020 under the concept, “Sufficiency for Sustainability.” ThaiBev also co-founded the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) to create collaboration among member companies by gathering ideas to generate insight in order to (1) protect business value through business continuity management, business laws, finance, and corporate social responsibility, (2) create value from investments by supporting existing business operations, i.e. cross-selling, cross-training, joint ventures, or resource sharing, and (3) innovate through investment in startup funds for social enterprises, cross-sharing business skills, or developing programs to promote the country’s economic development for a more stable and sustainable future.

### Insights from Sustainability Expert

“Leaving no one behind” is an integral part of ASEAN’s sustainable development approach, and it is a fundamental principle in our attempt to build a people-oriented, people-centered ASEAN Community. As a developing region, ASEAN faces pressing challenges from rapid urbanization, strong population growth, and depletion of natural resources. We are also one of the world’s most vulnerable regions in terms of climate change and natural disasters. To address these challenges, ASEAN is cultivating a “Culture of Prevention” to promote peace, resilience, and care for the environment. The region and its people are actively seeking ways to prevent the risks of natural, human-induced disasters and environmental degradation.

This year, COVID-19 has wrought unprecedented socio-economic effects on the region, and the pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for people to reflect on their relationship with the environment. There is an understanding that sustainability should be viewed as a “cross-pillar” issue, given its interconnectedness with so many other important aspects of life.

Businesses play an important role in safeguarding employment and bringing products and services to the market. However, with the global landscape transformed by COVID-19, it is highly unlikely that commercial enterprises or industries will embrace a “business-as-usual” approach in the post-pandemic era. Digital technologies have gradually emerged as part of the “new normal” in doing business in ASEAN. In the long run, businesses will be expected to promote sustainability and inclusivity in their operating models and practices.

The Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) – Spokesperson

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a broader and more severe impact than the MERS and SARS epidemics did in the past. One especially threatening aspect of COVID-19 is that infected people can be asymptomatic while the virus is in its incubation period. This results in a higher number of infected individuals in the community. The government had to announce a state of emergency and instruct people to stay at home. The order caused a decrease in consumption and investment leading to closure and/or scaling down of some businesses.

Thailand’s measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have been efficient due to collaborative efforts from all sectors. Government, the private sector, and individuals joined together to combat this crisis. However, many countries are now facing a second wave of infections. Therefore, Thailand needs to continue to monitor and maintain control measures together with strict prevention guidelines.

It is admirable that during this crisis, ThaiBev worked to assist Thai society and the economy by producing and distributing alcohol gel and masks to employees, partners, hospitals, and other organizations all over the country. ThaiBev’s policy not to reduce or terminate employees has helped move our society and economy forward.

Besides taking care of their employees’ health, the private sector can also respond to the pandemic by exploring models and creating innovations to strengthen public health in the country, including technology for vaccine production. When our citizens have good health, our country will be able to further develop in many areas ranging from well-being, arts and culture development to economic prosperity.

### Assessment of Key Sustainability Issues

In 2020, ThaiBev reviewed key sustainability issues for the organization by considering global trends and changes in sustainability issues within the food and beverage industry, issues in accordance with international sustainability standards, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. ThaiBev conducts assessment of key sustainability issues every 3 years and reviews them every year through the following processes.

1. **Identification of Issues**
   - ThaiBev organized workshops for executives and experts from business units to examine and determine the sustainability issues that are relevant to business operations. This involves analyzing global trends and changes in sustainability issues of the industry, as well as identifying stakeholder groups and corporate sustainability issues.

2. **Issue Prioritization**
   - ThaiBev prioritized the identified sustainability issues through 2 activities consisting of:
     1. Workshops for ThaiBev senior executives to consider and assess the impacts of sustainability issues on the organization by considering the impacts in 3 aspects: finance, operations, and reputation.
     2. In-depth interviews with domestic and international representatives from all 8 stakeholder groups to understand the significance and potential impacts. The results of these 2 activities were used to screen sustainability issues for the organization. Issues that were ranked as very important by ThaiBev and stakeholders were considered material sustainability issues.

3. **Validation**
   - The Sustainability Development Working Team (SDWT) comprehensively reviewed and presented the material sustainability issues to the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee (CSDC) and the Executive Committee for approval.

4. **Reporting Boundary**
   - For comprehensiveness and accuracy of the material sustainability issues, ThaiBev determined the reporting boundary of all 17 material sustainability issues based on the information collected from various agencies and relevant stakeholder groups.

5. **Continuous Development**
   - ThaiBev is committed to operate under the sustainable development framework through annual review of sustainability issues taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives on those issues as well as in-depth interviews. The material sustainability issues are used as guideline for business operations.


# ThaiBev Material Sustainability Issue

In 2020, ThaiBev reviewed key sustainability issues for the organization and added one material issue to the original list of 16 in 2019 to 17 issues in 2020 in response to global trends and stakeholder concerns.

The COVID-19 pandemic saw new government measures to address the problem, such as home quarantine and physical distancing requirements. These resulted in changes to people’s daily lives and consumption behaviors as they adapted to “new normal” lifestyles. There has been a notable rise in online shopping, for instance, amidst consumers’ broader concerns about health and safety.

An assessment of key sustainability issues found that stakeholders are concerned about the safety of both products and services, as well as employees’ safety in the workplace. The disruption in supply chains has resulted in changes in key sustainability issues with important implications. Major issues include:
- Consumer health and safety
- Sustainable supply chain
- Product health and nutrition

- **Mobile applications for consumer convenience.**  
  These include the OISHI’s BevFood application which has several functions including food ordering, seat reservation, point collection, discount vouchers, and promotional updates. Another example is the HoReCa application which allows customers to order non-alcoholic beverages and other products to be delivered directly to their residences.

- **Delivery services.**  
  Delivering staff are required to wear masks, frequently wash and disinfect their hands with 70% alcohol while working, and keep at least 1 meter distance from customers. They also regularly disinfect their food box, motorcycle throttles, helmet, and keys.

# Risk Management

ThaiBev manages risks in operations and management system in accordance with our sustainability strategy by monitoring, evaluating, and managing uncertainties that may represent significant corporate risks or opportunities for sustainable growth. Risk management enables ThaiBev to prevent and mitigate impacts, respond to challenges, and take full advantage of the arising opportunities to achieve the goal of becoming a stable and sustainable total beverage leader in ASEAN.

# ThaiBev’s Risk Management Strategy in a Crisis Situation

In late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic spread and intensified in countries across the globe, including Thailand. At present, the COVID-19 crisis remains ongoing with no end in sight. It has severely impacted human livelihoods and business operations causing global economic disruption. It has affected supply chains resulting in business closures, job retrenchment, and decline in consumption of goods. ThaiBev recognizes that the pandemic is a public health crisis that severely impacts people’s health and living conditions. If employees are infected or at risk of infection, business operation could be impacted putting pressure on business continuity and credibility. Therefore, successful management of risks from COVID-19 pandemic is vital to business survival. ThaiBev has implemented measures to mitigate risks to employees, relevant parties, or business operations and continues to create value for society. ThaiBev implemented the following risk management measures during the COVID-19 crisis:

1. Conducted business operations in alignment with governmental policies and measures on COVID-19 by focusing on production and logistics of finished products as well as providing services that are essential to society.
2. Implemented health prevention, safety and wellbeing measures for employees, business partners, and members of Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN).
3. Provided assistance to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19 through own initiatives and collaboration with external organizations and business alliances.
4. Contributed to economic and social recovery particularly the economy at grassroots and community levels.

By implementing the above measures, ThaiBev was able to manage the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on business and stakeholders promptly allowing ThaiBev to continue business operations without interruption during COVID-19 crisis.

For the risk management under uncertainties or in times of crisis to be effective and efficient, a clear enterprise risk management framework and systematic risk management process are the key element and foundation. ThaiBev’s enterprise risk management framework based on the COSO: Enterprise Risk Management Framework has been implemented with the following key components:

1. **Governance structure** covering Board of Directors, Sustainability and Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, Executive Committee, Corporate Sustainability Development Committee, Specific Committees appointed by the Management Committee, Sustainability Development Working Team, Corporate Risk Management Working Team, and the risk coordinators of product groups or business units.

2. **Understanding of context and strategies in conducting business with a focus on sustainable development**, where all functions align on such commitment for food and beverage business by analysing and monitoring risk factors and significant future trends that may affect business operations or corporate strategies.

3. **Holistic risk management process** from corporate to operating levels by collecting information, identifying and assessing key risks, and establishing strategies and systematic approaches for managing risks, including creating new business opportunities in line with the strategies and the sustainability materiality of ThaiBev.

4. **Communication, reporting, and evaluation of risk and sustainability measures** at all levels, ranging from departments, subsidiary entities, business units, product groups to the corporate level, in a clear and continuous manner. For example, the progress of sustainability projects or risk management activities, potential risks that may impact ThaiBev, risk indicators, etc.

5. **Sustainability and risk management culture** through training, processes, and activities for executives and employees at all levels throughout the organization to create awareness on the importance of the sustainability and risk management to encourage engagement in the sustainable development and risk management of the organization.

# COVID-19 Crisis and Risk Management at ThaiBev

The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant risk factor that brought about various risks that could impact ThaiBev’s business operations, such as risks associated with employee health, supply chain management, financial liquidity, and corporate image and reputation. If there is news regarding ThaiBev employees being infected with COVID-19, or an infected visitor/customer entering ThaiBev production facilities, office buildings, sales and service premises, or any of them become infected after coming to ThaiBev’s facilities, it could lead to the closure of those areas. This could also have a long-term effect on operations due to delays or inability to follow business plans. Given that COVID-19 pandemic continues to be an ongoing crisis with no end in sight, operating business cannot follow business-as-usual strategies or approaches. ThaiBev must implement contingency plans to manage the rapidly changing situation in order to prevent and mitigate impacts as much as possible.

In March 2020, ThaiBev’s management established the following:

- **COVID-19 ThaiBev Situation Room** to monitor business continuity in sourcing, production, transportation, and distribution by creating business and employee database, analyzing information and news and internal information to assess, decide and plan responses to the situations in the short and long terms.

- **COVID-19 Relief Center** to collect information, communicate necessary information, and provide health and safety assistance to employees, especially personnel in Thailand (where there are more than 49,000* persons), including measures in the workplace and for operations under the COVID-19, the provision of COVID-19 prevention and risk-avoidance gear to employees and their families, the purchase of accident and COVID-19 insurance, and the provision of COVID-19 screening tests as part of its employees’ welfare at the cost of approximately 39.2 million baht.

*Information as of March 2020

# Commitments and Achievements

The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted business and stakeholders. To develop appropriate risk management measures, ThaiBev reviewed sustainability material topics in 3 dimensions (environment, society, and economy) and existing corporate sustainability risks. The post-review sustainability risks are categorized into 3 groups.

1. **Existing risks with unchanged risk level**, e.g.
   - Water-related risks
   - Climate change risks
   - Employees’ occupational health and safety risks due to COVID-19 infection
   - Product quality and safety risks due to COVID-19 contamination
   - Regulatory compliance risks as government issued special orders to control COVID-19 pandemic
   - Financial risks, particularly financial liquidity and interest rate fluctuation

   Although these risks are not directly related to the COVID-19 crisis, ThaiBev continues to monitor and analyze changes in risk level periodically, and maintains pre-COVID-19 risk management plan.

2. **Existing risks with higher risk level**, e.g.
   - Supply chain risks as business operations were halted by COVID-19 pandemic causing increases in risk with higher operating costs and lack of raw materials or delayed delivery causing supply chain disruptions during lockdown

   All risks with increased risk level could impact production, delivery of products and services to customers, which could affect income or sales as well as profit and performance. ThaiBev closely monitors and manage these risks to avoid interruptions to business operations that could adversely impact reputation and brand image.


### 3. New risks, e.g.

- Risks of restaurants located in shopping malls
- Risks of dine-in restaurants, especially those in fine-dining segment
- Risks of selling alcoholic beverage through restaurant channel
- Cyber risks
- Information security risks

These new risks arise from “new normal” lifestyles and business contexts related to COVID-19, such as government lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulting in the shutdown of dine-in restaurants, physical distancing, and avoidance of crowded places. The emergence of the COVID-19 is also a catalyst for people to adopt more digital technology in their work and daily lives from ordering food and shopping online to payment through smartphones or electronic systems to avoid contact with banknotes or coins. All of these impact the demand for products and services and led to drastic changes in consumer behavior and business models.

### Opportunities from COVID-19 Crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many businesses to lose income and business shut down, but it has also catalyzed many organizations, including ThaiBev, to transform business strategies and invest in digital technology and innovations for business activities along the value chain from sourcing, production, distribution, marketing and sales to post-consumption packaging management, to change business model to full-scale digital business. This creates new business opportunities by preparing for future changes and offering customers new experiences that are better than the existing products and services. Some businesses experienced rapid growth during the COVID-19 crisis; however, the growth varies depending on the pandemic’s cycle. For instance,

- In the early and widespread stages, there was significant demand for hygiene and health-related products. The demand for delivery of products and e-commerce increased more than usual.
- In the later stage when the outbreak subsided and controlled, people started returning to their normal lifestyles resulting in increased transportation, whether for leisure or business, and demand for products and services gradually returned to a normal level.

ThaiBev adjusted its business and service models through the transition of COVID-19 pandemic stages. For instance, in the early stage, ThaiBev focused on the production of drinking water to meet national demand. ThaiBev launched marketing promotions and advertisements on social media, implemented online ordering systems through the BevFood application, partnered with food aggregators to extend ordering and delivery services to more consumers. These business activities provide convenient online ordering and delivery, both of which increased drastically during this time. Forecasts suggest that this trend will continue to develop further in the long run. Even when the COVID-19 pandemic is fully under control or ends, ThaiBev will remain committed to developing new products, especially healthy beverages and food products, and to leverage digital technology in its business operations, including innovations in order to create opportunities and sustainable business growth for the future.

# Information Technology and Cyber Security

Information technology has rapidly advanced. It allows easy, convenient, and fast access via many types of communication devices. But at the same time, cyber espionage for electronic information has increased drastically and is a major cyber threat. ThaiBev values information security for all stakeholders, consumers, customers, employees, raw material suppliers, and other stakeholders related to the company both directly and indirectly. Therefore, there is a strong need for cyber risk management mechanisms that can prevent access to information that could damage the business, disrupt its operations and services, or lead to leaks of personal information. This could lead to higher costs, damage to the company’s reputation, and fines and loss of income due to loss of customers. Therefore, ThaiBev understands the importance of bolstering the company’s information technology security and has created plans to respond to many different threat scenarios.

# Cyber Risk Management Approaches

ThaiBev has implemented cyber risk management and information security protocols meeting top international standards, like ISO 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework. These cyber security frameworks include prevention plans, detection, and rapid responses to threats in compliance with global standards. There are 5 main processes, including:

## Cyber Risk Management 5 Processes

1. **Identify** - Identify risks to specify the scope and method to assess cyber risk.
2. **Protect** - Establish standards to control and prevent information technology system risks.
3. **Detect** - Detect, analyze, and monitor suspicious cyber activities, and issue alerts.
4. **Respond** - Identify management’s approach to respond to and address risks.
5. **Recovery** - Identify measures for damage recovery to continue business operations.

The Board of Directors and executives at ThaiBev contribute to the identification of strategies related to information technology security, together with cyber security and procedures, so they are in line with corporate guidelines and international standards. They also oversee the operations to ensure that business strategies and plans cover corporate information security through ThaiBev’s governance structure.

Additionally, the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee is also responsible for ensuring that it is well prepared and has addressed information security and cyber security among ThaiBev’s potential risks. The ThaiBev Information Technology Committee ensures that the Company’s information technology and cyber risks can be managed effectively and that all potential negative impacts on the organization and its business opportunities can be mitigated.

# Information Technology Security Policy

ThaiBev’s information technology policy focuses on information security, including cyber security and other aspects of information technology. It does this through rules, regulations, and guidelines that seek to protect ThaiBev’s information technology property from unauthorized access, as well as through clear corporate policy directions, including by ensuring that the organizational structure and corporate strategy are in accordance with the information technology security policy.

# Personal Data Protection Corporate Practices

ThaiBev follows laws on personal data protection according to the Personal Data Protection Act, and on the protection of cyber security through the Cyber Security Act B.E. 2562. In addition, ThaiBev issues corporate rules and regulations on personal data protection in 2020 to serve as a strict guideline for executives and employees.



*ThaiBev received the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Certification dated 28 September 2020 and plans to expand the scope to cover the entire system.*

# Insight

BJC Glass has been using cullet in our production process since 1951. A strategic partnership with ThaiBev started in 2016 through a supplier and customer collaboration. With existing ThaiBev infrastructure across Thailand, the 2 companies have formed a partnership in the cullet supply chain, resulting in benefits to both parties. The partnership has so far led to 334,000 tonnes of cullet being recycled, or an equivalent to 18% of annual recycled cullet used by BJC Glass. BJC Glass is able to use up to 50% cullet in the smelting process, compared to 25% typically used in European glass factories. Using cullet helps to reduce energy consumption in the melting process, and avoids waste being sent to landfills. Glass produced from cullet has no reduction in strength or other properties, so it is a truly circular process. An estimated 0.24 kgCO₂e per bottle is avoided per kg of recycled cullet used in the production process. In wider sustainability, BJC Glass is able to realize economic benefits such as reduced raw material price and streamlined supply chain operations. In the social field, we see opportunities being provided through additional income for communities in collecting and selling cullet to Thai Beverage Recycle or BJC Glass. We also have established campaigns and promotional materials to increase awareness around the opportunities and benefits to society of glass recycling. As a supplier to ThaiBev, we also collaborate on initiatives such as lightweight packaging design for glass bottles. Bottle weight reduction can reduce the carbon footprint of ThaiBev products, as lightweight bottles save emissions in the production process and logistic operations.

The company therefore applied technologies to initiate new production processes and continuously improve energy efficiency by increasing the use of alternative and environmentally friendly energy as well as developing more low carbon products to reduce GHG emissions from energy usage with optimal benefit.

*GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-3, GRI 302-1, GRI 302-3, GRI 302-4, GRI 302-5*

# Energy Efficiency

## Energy Audit Project

ThaiBev performed an energy audit in every business unit to explore the possibilities of reducing energy consumption through technologies, innovations, or the use of alternative energy. A working team on energy management is appointed for each business unit to assess energy consumption while seeking greater efficiency in reducing GHG emissions.

## Once Through Boiler

The spirits and beer groups installed "Once Through Boilers" (water tube boilers) that can operate with a fast and continuous response when steam is required in the production process. They increase energy efficiency and reduce power consumption. 

- **Spirits Group**: 
  - Lowered fuel oil use by 346,500 liters per year.
  - GHG emission reduction of 1,052 tCO₂e per year.

- **Beer Group**: 
  - Reduced coal use by 6,306 tCO₂e per year.
  - GHG emission reduction of 10,300 tCO₂e per year.

In 2020, the non-alcoholic beverage group, such as Sermsuk PLC, installed Once Through Boilers using LPG as its fuel, replacing 4 old boilers which used fuel oil. This helps in increasing energy efficiency and lowering GHG emissions by as much as 1,159 tCO₂e per year, with an investment cost of 6,000,000 THB.


# Energy Management

## Installation of High-Power Motor

# Biogas Plant Project Overseas

A biogas plant at Balmenach Distillery, part of Inver House Distillers in Scotland, one of the country’s greenest distilleries, prioritizes on GHG emissions per product unit or Carbon Footprint.

This plant uses by-product of whiskey distillation to produce biogas to be used to generate electricity for the factory. Surplus electricity is also sold to a local grid. This project is an addition to the biomass plant, which uses wood pallets as its main energy source for malt whiskey distillation, which reduced GHG emissions by 10,000 tons in the past 2 years.

This biogas plant is in the commissioning phase, expected to lower GHG emissions by 5,150 tCO₂e per year and reduce the amount of power purchased from local energy providers by 49.9 million THB. The investment of this project is 120 million THB. With the completion of this project, The Balmenach Distillery will be a distillery that fully operates on renewable energy in producing malt whiskey.

# Low-Carbon Products

ThaiBev is committed to climate change impact and encourages the development of low-carbon products that reduce GHG emissions to address the impact on consumers and environment by collaborating with its business partners through innovation and technology, i.e. weight reduction in PET bottles, aluminum cans and glass bottles.

This year, ThaiBev registered for certification in GHG emissions for plant operations (Carbon Footprint for Organization: CFO) and GHG emissions of products (Carbon Footprint of Product: CFP) from the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization). 17 companies under the Group are registered for CFO and 105 products have received CFP certifications.

Moreover, products such as alcoholic beverages (beer) and non-alcoholic beverages (drinking water and green tea) have received carbon footprint reduction labels from the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization). The label indicates that the products have passed a carbon footprint audit and are able to lower GHG emissions not less than 2% when comparing the current carbon footprint with a baseline year.

# Insight

The climate change has become more intense these days. As a beverage producer, we recognize that Carbon Footprint Product (CFP) and Carbon Footprint Reduction (CFR) labels serve to demonstrate our environmental and social responsibility commitment by assessing greenhouse gases emissions throughout the product’s life cycle, from raw material sourcing, transportation, production, consumption, to post-consumption management.

Our product development takes into account resource utilization and technological improvement in production processes including the use of renewable energy such as biogas production instead of fossil fuels, and solar energy production. We also explore opportunities to develop packaging that require fewer natural resources or optimize existing resources through reusable and recyclable packaging, namely glass bottles, aluminum cans, and PET bottles, aiming to increase consumer awareness of environmental issues.

The Beer and Non-Alcoholic Beverage groups are committed to renewing CFP and CFR labels continuously by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization). At present, 22 products from our beer and non-alcoholic beverage portfolios received these labels; representing 64% of revenue. All of our beer and non-alcoholic beverage production sites earned Carbon Footprint for Organization (CFO) certification accounting for 100% of revenue. In addition, we plan to educate ThaiBev Group’s personnel to improve their knowledge about CFP and CFR labels to support ThaiBev’s sustainability efforts in the future.

# Water Stewardship

Water is a vital resource. Economic and urban expansion have led to increased need for water. ThaiBev, as a major producer of beverages and foods, is determined to sustainably and efficiently manage water usage to address risks and changes in patterns of water consumption, to help avoid water scarcity in the future. ThaiBev has performed a comprehensive water management analysis that considers the entire value chain. The company encourages the development of innovations to maximize efficiency in water usage, and to control the quality of water discharged into surface water to ensure that it meets quality standards. ThaiBev assesses the sustainability of water usage to reduce the risks and impacts of water consumption for both short and long term. Furthermore, the company has also collaborated with local communities to protect and conserve water resources in the communities thus ensuring that communities have access to clean water for better living and reduce the impact that may have on the ecosystem.

Sustainability Report 2020



Opas Angwornkul - The winner of Sustainability Action Hero Contest: UN SDG 6 "Clean Water & Sanitation", a joint project by C asean and The Royal Photographic Society of Thailand

ThaiBev sets its Corporate Water Management Policy prioritizing on comprehensive water management system covers the whole value chain, from water sustainability assessment at production facilities to evaluate level of water-related risks to setting a guideline for water management in each location. This includes water assessment throughout the product life cycle in order to optimize water management efficiency. Additionally, ThaiBev collaborated with stakeholders to conserve water resources and assisted communities in gaining access to clean water and reduce the impact on the ecosystem through the following projects:


# Surface Water and Groundwater Sustainability Assessment

ThaiBev regularly conducts a Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA) for both surface water and groundwater at production facilities to better understand and evaluate current water-related issues and/or future impact and risks associated with its business units. This in-depth assessment covers four dimensions: detailed water source assessment, including the availability of water sources, the internal structure of water resources, the vulnerability of the watershed, social and environmental factors, water-related natural occurrences, such as droughts, floods, etc.; and the quality of water sources. This assessment forecast covers the period of five years to ensure sustainable water supply to support the facilities' operation.

Processes in the study include:

## Water Sufficiency

- **Analyze and create a base map** of the production facilities with the help of USGS ASTER GDEM satellite imagery, Google Earth, field site visits, and other relevant maps of micro watershed within which the site’s water source exists (within approximately 50-70 kilometres) by collecting information on drainage areas, major aquifers and water bodies, catchment areas, geology, land use and land cover categories, crop types and irrigation inventory and source of potential water pollutants. The information gathered is presented in maps that show areal extent of the local watershed, factory locations, watershed boundaries, surface features including surface water bodies, land use/land cover, geomorphological features and drainage patterns, slope map and surface topography. There also are maps of slopes, possible underground catchment areas, and other geographical features of the surface.

- **Assess surface water source** by obtaining information from government water management agencies to characterize the surface water bodies. This includes checking available information (from public agencies in charge of water resources management, and other secondary sources for public) on rainfall data as well as water level variation in the rivers from the Royal Irrigation Department and surface water quality data from the Pollution Control Department.

- **Collect nearest rainfall data** from rain gauge station for the past 10-20 years, including average annual rainfall, intensity of rainfall (maximum and minimum), number of rain days, information on evaporation, historical events related to rainfall in the past 10-20 years - such as droughts and/or floods, and the restrictions on source water usage due to the earlier mentioned events, the interruptions to the production from these events (from production information) and recovery period from that stress period.

- **Explore the factories’ locations** and details about their water usage. This includes water storage such as raw water ponds, wastewater treatment system, etc.

## Water Quality

- **Field surveys** in the factory site and surrounding areas. The survey results will be documented with written field notes and photographs. The field survey methods are as follows:
  - Visually inspect land use pattern, land use of significant environmental concerns, and physical characteristics
  - Identify the potential contaminants associated with potential pollutant sources
  - Review any risk mitigating factors at the potential pollutant sources
  - Review publicly available current water quality and related trends within the watershed and groundwater basin.
  - Inspect of wastewater quality discharged from each activity of the factory


# Rules and Regulations Related to Water Resources

- Review rules and regulations related to surface water sources, together with regional and national water policies and regional regulations regarding surface water usage for industry as well as public. This includes internal structures for sustainably reserved water in order to provide water for all stakeholders when it is in high demand (for industry, irrigation, and household use).

- Review publicly available databases on related laws and regulations in order to identify environmental concerns of government bodies in micro watershed.

# Stakeholders’ Perception

- Conduct perception survey of community members surrounding the factories to better understand:
  - Perception about water availability
  - Perception about water related impacts of the industry and way to mitigate that impact

- Additional analysis in order to better understand:
  - Broad socio-economic profile of the area
  - History of the community coming together for action
  - Perception towards the presence of the industry and expectations
  - Potential for opposition

ThaiBev employed satellite imagery to study watershed topography, water flow direction, drainage pattern, slope patterns of irrigation canals, rivers, canals, reservoirs, dams, and neighboring areas, together with trends of land usage during the past 10 years. This allowed ThaiBev to create a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy that is appropriate for local conditions while addressing both long-term and short-term risks.

This year, ThaiBev extended the Surface Water and Groundwater Sustainability Assessment to five more factories covering all business units. In the future, ThaiBev will expand this water assessment to cover all factories for its sustainable water management.

# Water Efficiency Program

Water Footprint is a tool to assess the environmental impact of water usage. It helps to prevent the deterioration of water quality both directly and indirectly. It can also be used to analyze and assess water usage volume, including the amount of contaminated water and the environmental impact in order to create a more efficiently water usage management.

ThaiBev applied the Water Footprint concept to measure water usage by adhering to the ISO 14046 standard, which is in line with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It includes the sourcing of raw materials, production processes, usage, and post-consumption waste management, which serves as a guideline to production process improvement by using water resources wisely and efficiently.

Furthermore, ThaiBev also improved water consumption processes throughout the product life cycle using the principles of the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. These help the company execute its water management sustainably and efficiently.


# Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels

Groundwater is one of the most valuable resources that people make great use of for a variety of activities, including domestic consumption, agriculture, industry, and tourism. To promote the industrial sector to share their social responsibilities to develop and conserve the groundwater, the Water and Environmental Institute of Sustainability and the Department of Ground Resources jointly organized a program called "Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels" to encourage industrial factories to develop an underground water storage (depth: not more than 15 meters) on their empty spaces for rainwater collection, which will work as a backup water source and add moisture to the ground, especially in areas that are prone to drought.

ThaiBev joined The Federation of Thai Industries and the Water and Environmental Institute of Sustainability in the Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels Program and 4 factories participated in order to be a prototype factory for suitable aquifer recharging systems and recognizing the corporate social responsibility to nearby communities. The method of groundwater recharge is to harvest rainwater and keep at shallow levels (not more than 15 meters deep) to preserve the natural water balance without affecting the ecosystem and the environment. This project aims to be completed in 2021 with expected benefits, as follows:

- Prototype recharging system for groundwater at shallow levels
- Ability to collect rainwater as a reserved water source in times of lacking
- To reduce impact of flooding around in the factories and neighboring areas
- To add moisture to the soil and create green areas
- To increase groundwater levels in the long term
- To support corporate social responsibility in the industrial sector

# Conservation of Upstream Forest and Water Sources Care with Communities

In order to conserve upstream forests and replenish clean water to nature, while restoring water resources and the ecological system, ThaiBev supported the following community activities and projects:

- **Wastewater Management Through Artificial Wetlands**  
  Th Knockdhu Distillery Co., Ltd., a subsidiary company in Scotland, developed wetland, to manage its waste water from distillation process in the 2,000 square meters land in the factory area and planted 17 different species of plants and over 21,000 individual plants. The wetland attracted insects, which in turn attract bats and birds’ nests that help increase biodiversity to the area. This wetland also reduced carbon emission by 45 tonnes per year from not trucking the effluent out of the factory.

- **Clean Water Project in Myanmar**  
  The Grand Royal Group International (GRGI) continues its ‘Clean Water Project’ which was started in 2016 by working with various parts of Myanmar to allow communities access to clean water sources for daily use. This year GRGI explored the Magway area which currently facing the problem of scarce water resources and provided the budget of 957,000 THB for building 3 buildings equipped with water filtration system and well. They commenced the trial run in November 2019 and officially handed over December that year. This project helps more than 7,500 households or more than 50,000 people gain access to clean and safe drinking water.

### Clean Drinking Water for Children
ThaiBev promotes and supports access to clean water for schools in areas surrounding its factories. In 2020, ThaiBev partnered with Wat Phagum School in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya province and Ban Nong Chak School in Chonburi province to improve the school drinking water systems for 1,050 students and staff so that they always have access to clean, hygienic drinking water that meets quality standards. This included the provision of maintenance services, monthly water-quality tests and staff training on the usage and maintenance of the water filtration systems. ThaiBev plans to implement this project at all schools located near its production facilities.

### "Clean Canal" Project
The "Clean Canal" Project aims to raise awareness among residents who live along canals to value their resources. This is the fifth year that ThaiBev collaborated with community members and volunteers to clean the canals and collect garbage. Community members joined this project to create cleaner and more pleasant canals. This year, ThaiBev worked with communities along the river near Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan together with navy personnel, and ThaiBev volunteers and youth from the Beta Young Entrepreneur Project. They collected garbage, cleaned and treated wastewater in the community’s canals with an Effective Microorganism (EM) solution and ball sponsored by Fuengfuanant Company Limited, Prachin Buri province.

### Water Conservation Program
ThaiBev, Wang Yang Municipality, and Ban Wang Nam Traditional Community in Khlong Khlung district, Kamphaeng Phet province, jointly developed green areas surrounding their communities’ water sources, while planting 50 Silver Trumpet Trees and 10,000 Vetiver grasses.

### Mangrove Restoration and Conservation
ThaiBev and the Public Health and Environmental Unit of Nong Mai Daeng Municipality organized a mangrove plantation in 2020 in Khlong Kluea, Nong Mai Daeng Sub-district, Chonburi province. The project sought to conserve mangroves in nearby Chonburi communities and to increase awareness about the value of mangroves, including their role in helping to maintain balance in the ecosystem. Activities included plantation, training, and the release of marine species into the mangroves. Sermsuk Public Company Limited employees at a factory in Chonburi led the activity with the theme: “Sermsuk brought happiness to society.”

# Insight

## Water Management in High Water Stress Area

Water is an essential natural resource for the production process. The demand for water continues to increase but the availability of water is decreasing due to degradation of water resources, water pollution, and the effects of climate change. Beer group recognizes the importance of water conservation to maintain high water quality and ensure sufficient quantity for production while minimizing impact to the communities. Therefore, water management is identified as one of the key risks for the group. A monitoring system is established to closely monitor the quality and quantity of water to mitigate any possible impacts. The water risk assessment conducted using Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas by World Resources Institute (WRI) shows that some factories are located in high water stress areas. Therefore, we have collaborated with the private and government sectors to implement necessary measures regarding water usage and conservation practices.

This year, Beer Thai (1991) Public Company Limited participated in the Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA) which is an in-depth assessment of water-related risks, using satellite imagery to study changes in the geography to be able to develop appropriate plans for both within the production facility and the surrounding communities. The company also worked with the government sector by joining the "Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Level Project" led by the Water and Environmental Institute of Sustainability and the Department of Ground Resources. The objectives are to harvest rainwater and recharge ground water as well as enhancing stakeholder engagement.

Beer group fosters an innovative culture through the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) program and encourages employees to propose ideas to conserve water using the 3Rs concept: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Some of the initiatives resulting from the program include produce utility water from backwash water, improve the efficiency of CIP Process (Cleaning in Place) to be able to use final rinse as pre-flush water, and use technology to improve process efficiency of water usage. Prior to the construction of a new production facility, water sustainability such as quantity, quality and impacts to the surrounding communities are considered along with the selection of machinery equipment to optimize water and energy efficiency.

In order to build good relationships with stakeholders surrounding the production sites, the company initiated community development programs by installing drinking water systems for students and school staff so they have access to clean and hygienic drinking water through the "Clean Drinking Water for Children" Project. The project's ongoing monitoring process ensures that the water generated through these systems maintains at the best quality. For example, a monthly water test to guarantee that the quality meets drinking water standards, collaboration projects such as constructing waterway systems by dredging and expanding existing waterways to mitigate impacts from flooding and prevent wastewater clogging, which could affect the health and hygiene of local communities.

# Waste and Packaging Management and Circular Economy

As the role of packaging has evolved over the years, ThaiBev strives to reduce the amount of resources used to produce its packaging through the design and selection of environmentally friendly materials. It also considers the possibility of circulating them after consumption to reduce waste. This is especially the case with primary packagings such as glass, paper, aluminum cans, and PET bottles. Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd. (TBR), a subsidiary of ThaiBev, is responsible for the collection of post-consumption packaging for reuse or recycling. ThaiBev also works with various stakeholders throughout its value chain, including tier 1 and non-tier 1 suppliers, small business owners, as well as consumers to manage and create value for post-consumption packaging via Circular Economy model.

# Replacement Plastic Packaging in Food Delivery with Paper Packaging

OISHI Group has changed its packaging used in food delivery from single-use plastic to more environmentally friendly paper packaging. This led to a reduction of more than 8 tons of plastics.

![Reduce Plastic](image)



# Plastic Shrink Film made from Recycled Materials

ThaiBev has worked with business partners to develop plastic shrink film from recycled materials. This plastic film is used for wrapping packs of Crystal Drinking Water in all sizes including 350 ml, 600 ml, 1,000 ml, and 1,500 ml. This plastic film is made of polyethylene (PE), with a 25% recycled component. The shrink film made using recycled PE has been used since May 2020. This innovation helps to reduce plastic waste by 45 tons and reduce GHG emissions by 53 tCO₂e per year.

# Bring Back-Recycle

TBR aims to promote post-consumption packaging management through engagement activities and encourage end users to participate in waste sorting so that recyclable packaging can be properly managed. TBR set out to find a sustainable solution and established the "Bring Back-Recycle" campaign encouraging ThaiBev employees to sort their trash. Under this campaign, recyclable packaging waste such as glass bottles, aluminum cans, and PET bottles are sold, and the earnings are donated to ThaiBev’s employees’ fund. Employees can follow up on the latest updates on the donations via "OK Recycle" application developed by TBR in collaboration with the Office of Information Technology and Digital Experience - the Office of Sustainability Development. The application systematically records recycling activities and relevant information. TBR also works closely with the Thailand Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE) and encourages the use of this application in activities which are organized by governmental agencies.

Moreover, TBR has set out to encourage consumers to take part in waste sorting to ensure that recyclable post-consumption packaging is actually recycled. Hence, TBR reaches out to the general public by collaborating with external parties and attending public events such as:

- At the Holy Mass at the Supachalasai National Stadium which was presided over by Pope Francis, TBR together with Less Plastic Thailand had installed 40 PET bottles recycling stations all over the venue in order to encourage the 50,000 Catholics participants to participate in the campaign “Green Angels” from TBR positioned on ground to assist and provide waste sorting instructions.

- At the annual MTM Field Merchandise Seminar 2020, Modern Trade Management Co., Ltd. and TBR promoted recycling of Chang beer, Kulov, and est aluminum cans in order to raise awareness about waste sorting and installed recycling stations for aluminum cans and PET bottles. The 1,300 employees who attended the event were educated to properly discard these packagings after consumption by emptying the container, squeezing to reduce space and discarding them into the correct bin. TBR aimed to collect all 5,000 aluminum cans and PET bottles that were distributed for recycling. At the end, over 75 kilograms of packaging waste had been retrieved (60 kilograms of cans and 15 kilograms of PET bottles).

# Buriram Marathon 2020

- At the Buriram Marathon 2020, held at the Chang International Circuit and Chang Arena in Buriram, waste sorting activities were organized. TBR installed 17 recycling stations to sort PET bottles with on-ground staff available to give instructions on how to properly discard the bottles by emptying the container, squeezing to reduce space, and discarding them into the correct bin. A total of 61 kilograms or 4,066 PET bottles were collected for recycling.

# Bring Back Home Project

The project is a collaborative effort between ThaiBev and its agents, or distributors, to collect used glass bottles of beer and spirits. In this new takeback model, the agents collect packaging from retail stores/restaurants and sub-agents who are their customers. These post-consumption packaging will then be retrieved back to TBR factories via backhauling. The project had been successfully initiated with one of ThaiBev’s agents in Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand, with plans in place to extend this model to other distributors throughout the country.

## Process Flow

- **Collection Center**: Collects used packaging.
- **Manufacturer**: Processes and refills bottles.
- **Backhaul**: Transports packaging back to TBR factories.
- **Sales Agent**: Distributes products.
- **Retail Store/Restaurant**: Sells products to consumers.
- **Sub Agent**: Acts as intermediary in the distribution chain.


# Products from rPET Fiber

PET bottles can be upcycled to produce rPET (recycled PET) fiber, a value-added recycling method. In 2020, over 7.6 million PET bottles were retrieved by TBR and sent to an rPET fiber manufacturer to make, for the first time, 200,000 rPET blankets to be donated under the campaign “ThaiBev... Unites to Fight the Cold”, a project that has been on-going for 21 consecutive years. The production of rPET fiber uses 94% less water and 60% less energy than the typical production of polyester fiber. This results in a 32% reduction of GHG emissions or 7 tCO₂e compared to the traditional production of 2,000,000 blankets. This marks an important step as ThaiBev has incorporated sustainability into its community development program, reducing a negative impact on the environment while creating positive societal impacts.

## Commitments and Achievements

ThaiBev places great importance on innovations and product design, including the return of post-consumption packaging into production processes, with targets set to to reduce, reuse, and recycle.

### 1. Reduce Packaging Weight and Volume

ThaiBev collaborates with business partners to develop packaging using fewer natural resources. Examples include reducing the weight of aluminum cans and the weight of plastic PET water bottles. ThaiBev have also recently implemented the technique called Narrow Neck Press and Blow (NNPB) in production of Hongthong spirits in 700 ml size which will be introduced in the market by the end of 2020. This collaborative effort between ThaiBev and its business partners has been in development since 2019 with the aim to reduce energy usage and minimize natural resource consumption.

### 2. Collection and Sorting

Sorting of different types of packaging and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills. TBR is responsible for the post-consumption collection and sorting process. TBR buys all types of ThaiBev packaging materials such as glass bottles, cans, plastic bottles, PET bottles, cardboard boxes, etc.

### 3. Reuse and Recycle

Packaging materials discarded after consumption can be collected and used as raw materials for manufacturing new products. TBR retrieves post-consumption packaging and sends it directly to packaging manufacturers or recyclers. Apart from collecting and sorting of post-consumption packaging, TBR also manages kitchen utensils and POP (point-of-purchase)/POS (point-of-sales) materials from ThaiBev’s restaurants that had gone obsolete or malfunctioned. These items are repaired or refurbished so that they can be utilized again.

# 4. Innovation and Product Design for Sustainable Packaging

ThaiBev has been continuously working with stakeholders to develop sustainable packaging, including packaging made from recycled components. ThaiBev established BevTech Co., Ltd. (BevTech) as a Research and Development center with one of the branches being Packaging Business in order to develop sustainable packaging innovations and alternatives. BevTech has been researching on machines and robotics to facilitate the use of automation in ThaiBev’s production facilities. The goal is to add capacity to business, increase efficiency and quality of production as well as to enhance safety in workplace, reduce labor risks, reduce waste and energy consumption that could potentially create negative environmental impacts. BevTech’s major achievement in recent years is the implementation of an automated bottle sorting conveyor belt (more information available in SR2018) and introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) bottle sorting technology to the system through collaboration with CMKL university. The solution optimized ThaiBev’s bottle sorting processes by reducing human error, reusable packaging losses, and overall operating costs. (More information can be obtained from Sustainability Report 2019.)


# Waste and Packaging Management and Circular Economy

## Insight

The Bring Back Home Project benefits both business and the environment. Of course, business is meant to generate income and profits and this project answered our quest. The project model is having agents or distributors at central collecting points to gather bottles from sub-agents or consumers and sell them back to ThaiBev, which helps to stimulate sales as well as create bonds between us and sub-agents. This doubles the benefits as they generate income from selling our products and from selling used bottles. Importantly, we provide pickup service at the locations for their convenience.

Looking at an environmental perspective, we also save the earth through this project because ThaiBev trucks that deliver products to agents usually return with empty loads. This project benefits from backhaul, which optimizes the use of energy. Additionally, good quality bottles that pass through standardized cleaning processes can be reused without requiring production of new bottles. This reduces energy consumption and natural resource consumption.

# Sharing the Value with the World

ThaiBev supports a wide range of social projects spanning education, health, sport, arts and culture, community development and Pracharath Rak Samakkee project. ThaiBev’s commitment to these projects has remained steadfast even during challenging times like the outbreak of COVID-19, and the company has launched new outreach initiatives not only aiming at society’s most vulnerable and needy, but also strengthening other aspects of development including the economic growth.

# Caring and Sharing, Creating Values for Society

Thailand and the world have faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the spread of COVID-19. The virus has impacted the livelihoods of tens of millions of people across ASEAN. In response to the pandemic, ThaiBev has increased its efforts to contribute to society and act as a socially responsible corporate business leader. ThaiBev did not seek to reduce the scope of its efforts, but instead remained dedicated to corporate social responsibility programs across a broad range of activities throughout Thailand, including across many demographics, while focusing on 5 key dimensions. These 5 dimensions include:

1. Education
2. Public Health
3. Sport
4. Arts and Culture
5. Community and Social Development

ThaiBev made substantial contributions to each segment in an attempt to empower people across society to reach their potential, and it adhered to its motto: “Always With You.”

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited
## Sustainability Report 2020

### In 2020, ThaiBev allocated more than 600-million-baht budget to 5 key areas, as follows:

| Key Area            | Percentage |
|---------------------|------------|
| Education           | 8%         |
| Public Health       | 31%        |
| Sport               | 36%        |
| Arts and Culture    | 14%        |
| Community Development | 11%      |

ThaiBev remains strongly determined to achieve its mission of "Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth" with its stakeholders. It seeks to accomplish this through various projects that help to build a stable environment and sustainable community. In 2020, ThaiBev supported clean water initiatives, a watershed reforestation project in a mountainous area, greenhouse gas emission projects, a blanket donation project, scholarship grants, initiatives to generate local income through the Pracharath Rak Samakkee projects, and scholarship donation to Partnership School. ThaiBev also has been consistent in supporting arts and culture as ThaiBev is aware that culture is important and must be preserved. ThaiBev also initiated a project to alleviate the impact of PM 2.5 and COVID-19 to protect the wellbeing of ThaiBev’s employees and public.

ThaiBev plans its Corporate Social Responsibility projects in 3 phases: short, middle, and long terms in five dimensions, and they are guided by top executives, led by CEO. Directors and employees are encouraged to participate in volunteer activities and all forms of public charity. Many working groups within the company are also dedicated to community development projects. These efforts are divided into 2 parts:

1. **At the corporate level**, these comprise a department dedicated to community development programs; a group that aims to enhance quality of life and help the environment; an external affairs group; a Thai talent project group; a group supporting arts and culture and C asean; a group from human resources; and a group from corporate communications.

   During mid-2019, the structure of corporate level CSR working groups have been organized to be more integrated. This led to a change in internal operations and cross operations between groups to be more effective. Weekly meetings have been arranged between project owners of 5 dimensional projects to discuss opinions, to seek connections between projects and to allocate budget for optimization. After this structural change, ThaiBev can create better value and reduce overlapping works by half.

2. **At the local level** near factories, these comprise public relations and environmental groups in each factory, which work in coordination with those at the corporate level. Each agency coordinates and operates projects that it has initiated, or in cooperation with various groups in society.

   These community development programs based on local communities’ needs include 100% coverage of ThaiBev operations that may have directly or indirectly impact the surrounding communities.

   In initiating projects and activities to benefit local communities, society, and the environment, ThaiBev abides by the following operating procedures:

   - It regularly assesses social and environmental impacts through relationships and by inquiring about the opinions or needs of the target community, including those in the areas around factories, or around any facility or community close to the company’s products. This is done using questionnaires, via interviews and public meetings, and by communicating with community leaders, parent groups, school boards or through weekly informal meetings (coffee council).
   - Projects are selected and operated together with stakeholders who are target groups to benefit the environment and community according to the objectives of the projects.
   - Every project must have concrete measures to assess its results, including by measuring the satisfaction of the community and stakeholders, social and environmental impacts, and follow-up reports by relevant bodies such as government agencies, universities, and civil society groups.

ThaiBev has collaborated with communities and other local bodies to establish an occupational health and safety committee, a local community consultation committee, and groups of personnel tasked with handling complaints and monitoring operational impacts. Such groups include public relations and environmental specialist teams, which are required to constantly monitor and report their findings in order to ensure that ThaiBev’s corporate social responsibility initiatives fulfill the needs of the communities and help to promote sustainable societies.

# Education Development

## Leadership for Sustainable Education Development Project (Connext ED)

Connext ED Project is an educational development project for primary and secondary schools across the country, in which ThaiBev partnered with 12 NGOs and 28 universities to organize related activities and programs consecutively. Last year, ThaiBev has continued its funding in “Tham Ma Kha Khai,” a simulated business project that has enabled more than 65,000 students from 263 schools in 44 provinces around the country to develop vocational and life skills, to learn from direct experience, and to get hands-on practice. Additionally, the program offers courses on financial accounting and business management for students to expand their business skills and add more value to their products. Partner universities also provide a course on household and business accounting to help participating teachers and students deepen their understanding of the topic and be ready for the real practices. Some businesses are able to generate profits and cashflow for expanding business opportunities without additional financial support. Besides, students can utilize their new skills to work professional jobs and generate income to support their family. They also learnt monetary discipline through making an income and expense account at least twice a week under the supervision and advice from university professors. 28 local education institutions and local schools also continue to collaborate in providing communities support, under His Majesty King Rama X’s Royal Guidance, which emphasizes universities’ roles in enhancing the wellbeing of their communities.

## OTOP Junior Contest

ThaiBev, in cooperation with the Bureau of Community Enterprise promotion, the Community Development Department, launched the OTOP Junior Contest as a platform to display skills and abilities of students who participated in a simulated business project, “Tam Ma Kha Khai” and encouraged them to become future entrepreneurs. The contestant team was required to present their project and answer questions from judges, who consisted of private sector, educational institutes, and government sectors, to compete for awards worth more than 500,000 baht.

Last year, 120 students from 100 clubs submitted entries. Prior to the contest, a 2-day hands-on training seminar was held by product development experts to strengthen the understanding of basic accounting, trading techniques, and product development to become future OTOP entrepreneurs. Moreover, 20 groups qualified to the final round will participate in a workshop with Ted Ex Bangkok to develop various skills including storytelling, client and context comprehension, presentation structures, and products’ and goods’ value enhancement. They had the chance to meet with Young OTOP entrepreneurs for inciting their inspirations and joined a Walk-Rally event with entrepreneurs to widen their business perspective at an OTOP City event.

### Leadership and Confidence

**Jirakan Duangprathum**  
Head of Nongkhaowitpitthayakom School Weaving Group

She won first place in the clothing and textile category in the OTOP Junior Contest last year. By submitting numerous contest entries the past few years and with her experiences in a project from the first year until now, Jirakan has made herself a more curious, inquisitive, expressive, and confident in her articulation than who she was previously as she used to be average in class, reserved and shy. Now she has been selected as her class representative for many school events and activities, such as presenting “1 School, 1 Innovation” project, which won her the 2019 national silver medal from the Teachers’ Council of Thailand. She also recently won the Sustainability Awards for Young Entrepreneur in the OTOP Junior Contest 2018. This has become the pride of Nongkhaowitpitthayakom school.

By observing changes in participating students and the benefits they received, I found students to have various improvement. First, they were exposed to the real world and gained experience, creativity, and self-discovery, which helped encourage them to appreciate themselves and others around them. Students laid a solid foundation in their career by increasing their ability to adapt to ever-changing global trading markets, seen in the recent outbreak of COVID-19. The students are considered of great help to their parents as they better recognize the importance of teamwork, virtue, and morality. These help forge constructive working habits, which can potentially help drive the nation forward.

## Creativity

**A story from a lemongrass transformation club at Banklongniengnangam School in Uttaradit: “Khrai Pa” (Lemon Grass Jam), the winner of the first prize in the food product category in the OTOP Junior Contest 2019, awarded in December 2019.**

After teachers and students brainstormed, looking at their school’s surroundings, the club pursued the idea of transforming lemongrass grown at the school and in Klong Riang Ngam Village into a lemongrass jam with medicinal qualities and into various products capable of long-term storage, such as lemongrass teas, herbal compress balls, balms, mosquito repellent sprays, mosquito repellent gels, mosquito repellent incense, lemongrass paper, and lemongrass jam. The products were distributed at the Free Market for Aspiring Future Career in the school, which organized monthly. The club also made a rap song to promote their products that received positive reactions and generated more sales. More importantly, this activity helped stimulate the students to recognize the value of life. As such, Banklongniengnangam School has adhered to the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy as a means to develop the students’ occupational skills. Once graduated, they can apply the knowledge and skills of Sufficiency Economy for their future careers.

## Ruam Pattana School (Partnership School Project)

The Partnership School Project has entered its second year in cooperation with the private sector, civil society, and other sectors in managing educational institutions and developing courses to solve local and the community’s needs. ThaiBev is one of the private companies that joined the educational committee to encourage educational transformation in accordance with the Thailand 4.0 policy. Seventeen volunteers come from ThaiBev’s senior executives who have expertise and agility, conduct on-site planning with teachers, principals, members of the Educational Institute Committee, and members of the community from 23 schools in 17 provinces to design and hold activities to unite temples, schools, and society to develop strong familial bonds, virtuous culture, occupational skills, and good citizenship skills. These are the foundation for further development of life. This reflects the concepts of “Bowon” (sublime) and “House, Temple, and School” that the private sectors, local social enterprises, and government agencies have incorporated into local development plan to promote the community and to organize the activities consistently.

### Opportunity and Accessibility

**Story from Siriwan Phudphong, Teacher Ann, Wat Singh, Chai Nat**

Students in medium-sized schools lack access to online classes due to inadequate equipment. More importantly, these students are also obliged to help their parents make money. They do so through activities such as packaging dried pork, sewing trousers for factory, and collecting watermelons. During the COVID-19 outbreak, family breadwinners often became unemployed and returned home with their absence of income and work. Student visits during the crisis emphasized the importance of occupational and life skills that could help see them through this challenging time.

To achieve this goal, various activities were organized to develop capable graduates to the society continuously.

- Business-focused activities were made more intensive. The project set a task for students to challenge themselves by setting up sale targets for them to initiate business plan to achieve and complete the target. Professors, ThaiBev employees, and senior students served as their coaches to give advices and follow up on their works weekly. The students must present a report once a month. Online became a main channel for students to seize the opportunity and make their sales due to COVID-19 situation. Many students successfully achieved their targets and generated even a seven-digit profit from their five-digit capital, which was unprecedented in the years before. The students could also expand this business into a career while studying.



# Education Development

- Charitable events sought to teach morality and virtue in business practices. Students joined as a group and donated some of the products from their start-ups and simulated companies to the community during the COVID-19 crisis. The project also provided help guide the students about self-care and self-protection during the COVID-19 outbreak when they must visit the community.

In 2020, there were a total of 15 graduates from the 6th batch of Beta Young, and a total of 52 students from 3 batches (Year 7-9) are still in the university. Students who have finished the program can utilize their start-ups idea to expand into their own business by applying knowledge and experience gained over the course of the curriculum. Many of them were accepted into top-tier companies, including ThaiBev subsidiaries.

## Goals of Beta Young Entrepreneurship Project

### 2021 Goals

- Build a community and network of all Beta Young batches as a way to provide connections, share stories, discuss or consult businesses, and pave the way for future cooperative businesses.
- Organize a 10-year anniversary of Beta Young in 2021. This reunion between current students and alumni aims to be a platform for exchanging knowledge, sharing experiences, and building connections that will make the Beta Young community even stronger.
- Cooperate with various ThaiBev projects and activities to reap shared benefits, such as bringing students to participate in the River Festival, ThaiBev United to Fight the Cold Project and ConnextED with the goal of enticing cooperation in at least 4 programs a year.

### 2025 Goals

# Education Institute Support Activity (EISA)

ThaiBev initiated the EISA program since 2016 to promote and support activities within universities as follows:

- Higher Education Sport Events
- Various student activities in the faculty and club activities, such as volunteer camp
- Promotion of practical curriculum such as simulated companies, field work studying local ways of life and building better quality of life for the community for self-sustainability, and introducing experts or executives as special lecturers.

ThaiBev cooperates with affiliated companies to introduce many projects to educational institutions and prepare them for real work experience and the integration of the market’s future workforce. Also, the project provides non-alcoholic beverage for university students.

Currently, EISA has cooperated with over 40 other higher educational institutions. The prominent change is stronger bonds among the faculties. The collaboration now spans over 54 faculties from 40 institutions, from our previous connection with only the central affair or the university executives.

With diversified relationships, EISA has diversified its network and projects. In addition to previously supported activities, EISA has also increased knowledge-based activities by providing the opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience through various events. For example,

# Education Development

In cooperation with the Faculty of Architecture, King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang set up the Bee-High Shop. Here, ThaiBev provided funding for construction and decoration, including shelves, cash registers, and products as a basis for business management in order to help the shop survive. It also introduced many retail and product experts to supervise students in this business simulation. Bee-High Shop is a platform where students can present their product designs, such as jewelries, packaging, etc., and is also a sole distributor for ThaiBev products, with more than 5,000 customers a day.

Additionally, ThaiBev also brought 30 industrial design students to the Bansawaisor Development Program in Buriram province to work with locals to develop a learning center for tourism and homestays. The students helped design signage around the village, make an application for customers to book stays online, improve product quality by designing new packaging (which also increased product value), and more. ThaiBev covered the students’ expenses for travel, food, and accommodation.

## Insight

Students from the Faculty of Architecture, KMITL, have visited Bansawaisor for the third time. Buriram was the first province for them to visit. Though it was far from the university, they worked systemically and worked hard. First visit was for understanding the community, observing the area and local potentials, and getting acceptance and welcome from the community. Initially, if we see the potential to work together and we see the uniqueness and character of the community or outstanding lifestyle, students will bring back these data as homework. It accountably is a learning stage from real working experience that are benefited by both people in Bansawaisor community and the students.

- Humanity. Despite different political, business, and social roles, we are all human. Conflicts may result from different opinions and misunderstandings may occur, but with open-minded and attentive listening, strong bonds can be achieved.
- Private sector is an enormous force in driving sustainable development. Initiating an idea is a good thing, and we support those who wish to make their ideas come true. Running a business account for a tool that builds knowledge and drives innovation eventually builds a solution that may solve global-scale problems.
- The goal is to create an ecosystem and network. Building a collaborative ecosystem and network where all units remain committed to solving problems throughout the production chain is a key to sustainable development.

# Public Health Development

**Public health** is a means of preventing and treating diseases to ensure the physical and mental health of the population. The wellbeing of citizens is a major contributor to individual, social, and national development. Therefore, ThaiBev continues to promote public health activities and provide support to public health organizations with the overall aim of making people healthier. ThaiBev has initiated strategies with our partners to promote preventive health knowledge, including with regards to kidney and heart diseases, as well as maintaining general health, in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on good health and wellbeing.

# Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital (Kidney Institute)

Asia’s leading hospital has been in operation since September 2012. It is fully equipped with a team of experienced doctors, physicians of different specialties, and nurses to provide 24-hour comprehensive care for both kidney diseases and general health. The Kidney Institute Hospital conducts research on the prevention of chronic kidney diseases and organizes a project every 3 months to raise awareness about kidney disease prevention and treatment. It also shares health care suggestions with the public and with patients so they have a better understanding of their symptoms and how to achieve a higher quality of life.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kidney Institute shared knowledge through its Facebook page and via public relations channels. In 2020, the institute’s research team hosted a major seminar titled “The Development of Chronic Kidney Disease Patient Treatment” as part of a research project for “The Study on Integrated Care Model for Kidney Disease Patients in Community Hospitals.” Since Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital’s inception, ThaiBev has worked with the hospital to promote knowledge about the prevention of kidney diseases.

The Kidney Institute currently works with 8,446 patients who are being treated with dialysis, and it has performed 49 successful kidney transplants to date.

Additionally, the Kidney Institute has helped promote relevant information and events, including World Kidney Day, during which it raised awareness about the dangers of kidney disease under the topic of “Screening, Prevention, and Awareness about Kidney Disease”. The institute also contributed articles on kidney disease through radio spot advertising. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the institute shared information with patients and others letting them know that there is a higher risk of infection among patients with kidney diseases. They also recommended special self-care measures.

It draws inspiration from Khun Charoen and Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi, who have said that "Thai people can support each other". Mobile medical units have also provided free medical examinations and treatment for people in the community each year, helping them save on the cost of hospital visits. In the past year, 1,102 people received the service.

# Commitments and Achievements

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequent impact on people's health, ThaiBev has communicated with medical sectors, government agencies, private organizations, and business groups to arrange and implement the following support schemes.

## Giving alcohol to fight against COVID-19

ThaiBev produced and distributed alcohol-based cleaning and sanitizing products (72% and 95% ethyl alcohol content) to public health service units, large medical centers, university hospitals and health units, hospitals under the Foundation for Good Governance on Medicine, Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Rajavithi Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Chulalongkorn Hospital, and other hospitals in different provinces nationwide to support preventive and protective measures against the spread of COVID-19. The alcohol cleaning supplies were also donated to temples, other religious places and organizations, foreign embassies and consulates in Thailand, the Royal Thai Navy, First Army Area, Airports of Thailand Public Company Limited, Pracharath Rak Samakee Network, and other civil society networks.

Furthermore, ThaiBev produced and distributed alcohol-based hand sanitizing sprays and other cleaning products to 470 educational institutions in the company’s network nationwide.

This involved coordination between private and government sectors in helping those affected by the pandemic.


# Public Health Development

- BevTech Co., Ltd., under ThaiBev, partnered with the Department of Medical Services of the Ministry of Public Health to support the production of alcohol-based cosmetics for good hand health. The current delivery included 1,088,176.02 units in total.

## Sourcing and manufacturing surgical masks and N95 respirator masks

ThaiBev imported 530,000 medical face masks from foreign countries, 130,000 of which were donated to 9 hospitals, including Yala Regional Hospital, Kamphaeng Phet Hospital, Pattani Hospital, Bueng Kan Hospital, Songkhla Hospital, Phichit Provincial Hospital, Satun Hospital, Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Hospital, and Su-Ngai Kolok Hospital. 400,000 other pieces were given to service staff to protect themselves while on duty. At the same time, ThaiBev planned new production lines and procured necessary machinery that could produce 3 million surgical masks and 1.2 million N95 respirator masks on a monthly basis. The production areas were arranged in sterile zones to promote safety. The surgical masks were distributed to employees, medical personnel, and the public.

## Donating 100 million baht to “Chaipattana Covid-19 Aid Fund (and Other Pandemics)”

The Chaipattana Covid-19 Aid Fund (and Other Pandemics) was established by the Chaipattana Foundation under the patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn to support hospitals and medical staff by providing equipment and other necessities for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The purpose of the support is to help hospitals and medical personnel procure medical equipment as the Chaipattana Foundation deems fit.

The Siriwadhanabhakdi Foundation by ThaiBev donated an allowance of 100 million baht and drinking water worth a total of 1 million baht to support the fund’s goal of supporting hospitals and medical staff.

## “OISHI Gives to Fight Against COVID-19” by Donating Money and Products Worth 24 Million Baht in Total to Medical Personnel

OISHI Group Public Company Limited, under ThaiBev, has partnered with the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade of Thailand to launch the “OISHI Gives to Fight Against COVID-19” campaign. 2 million baht was given to each of these 7 hospitals: King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Phramongkutklao Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Ramathibodi Hospital, Thammasat University Hospital, Rajavithi Hospital, and Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute. Moreover, OISHI food and beverages worth 10 million baht, consisting of OISHI Gold Premium Green Tea and OISHI Eato Sandwiches, were delivered to COVID-19 patient wards on a daily basis for 3 months, in order to support medical staff. The total donation of money and products was worth 24 million baht.

## OISHI under OISHI Green Tea Donates Alcohol to Victims in Neighboring Countries, including Laos and Cambodia

OISHI donated 3,600 liters of disinfectant alcohol to the Cambodian Ministry of Public Health and 2,100 liters to the Ministry of Public Health of Laos to distribute to hospitals in their countries.


# Prolab Vibhavadi Medical Technology Clinic

ThaiBev established this clinic as a virus infection investigation center with an aim to screen and provide free services to medical staff. Similarly, other government agencies and people, if interested, can make a request to get tested for infection at a lower fee than normal testing at general private hospitals which helps save costs in fighting COVID-19. The data collected from April 16 to July 21, 2020 showed that 12,077 ThaiBev employees received an infection test. Some 3,893 employees working for KFC, Starbucks, OISHI, and other restaurants by ThaiBev have already been tested for a second time. Also, because this group provides service to many customers on a daily basis, they are tested at least every 3 months to ensure customer safety. In total, ThaiBev employees have taken more than 15,970 infection tests. At present, ThaiBev strictly follows protective measures and has found no new cases of infection which accounts for success. The COVID-19 infection testing kit certified by the Department of Medical Sciences uses Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to identify COVID infection. This test can provide results for 500 cases on a daily basis and will be improved to provide up to 800-1,000 cases per day. The clinic employs semi-automate diagnostics kits developed by a South Korean biotechnology company, Bioneer, following testing guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO). It uses a Cobas 6800 Analyser, a fully automated real-time PCR system by Roche that is certified by the American Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and that is also used by Chulalongkorn University and Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute, to test for COVID-19.

# Moving Forward

ThaiBev continues to support public health activities for the community and to promote wellness for everybody in society. ThaiBev firmly believes that good health is true wealth and that it enables people to create positive things for themselves, society, and the country, while also living a happy life.



# Insight

## Wisit Prasitstirakul, M.D.
Deputy Director of Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to ThaiBev for providing to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute alcohol cleaning supplies that can be used to sanitize hands, disinfect medical equipment, and clean surfaces in the hospital. Despite the increasing demand for alcohol, the supplies they gave us can satisfy the institute’s need for more than 5 months. I’m thankful that ThaiBev understands the importance of fighting against the spread of COVID-19 and takes active participation. This can help us all get through this crisis together.

## Major Admiral Kasem Huanbuththa
Director of the Department of the Navy

The Department of the Navy uses alcohol to clean and sanitize the Sattahip COVID-19 Prevention Center, which is also a quarantine center for Thai citizens returning from Wuhan, China. We used alcohol that was donated to us to produce gel sanitizers for medical personnel in risky areas. At the prevention center, we use about 1,000 liters per month to sanitize the location, vehicles, and equipment. We must thank ThaiBev for supporting us and prioritizing personnel who are working hard in risky areas during this crisis.

# Athletic Development

Sport is important to quality of life’s development by boosting their overall physical and mental health. It invites active participation, creates a sense of community, and strengthens bonds in a family, while also promoting positive values, discipline, responsibility, and respect for fellow players and others – qualities at the foundation of a well-functioning society. For more than 20 years, ThaiBev has actively supported many types of sport, seeking to increase recognition and adopt top global standards. The company does so under the slogan: **“Give Opportunities through Sport, Create Values with Sportsmanship.”** ThaiBev wishes to see people throughout society embrace sportsmanship and enjoy robust physical and mental development. ThaiBev also builds partnerships and collaborations across the sport industry while developing truly quality personnel, including both players and coaches for the sport industry. The company also places special emphasis on youth sport and its environment. The goal is to create a solid foundation and build capacity for players to become professional athletes and for each sport to become national sport which eventually will help ThaiBev to develop its operation for sustainability.

# ThaiBev Football Academy

For more than 10 years, ThaiBev has organized international-standard football training and practice sessions for children between 6 and 18 years of age, free of charge. The young footballers train for 2 hours a day. Coaches and teams arrive a few hours before the scheduled time to plan training strategies and prepare spaces for practice. Practices are conducted according to the improvement of players’ abilities each time.

The project has led to large-scale changes in youth football development. More young footballers join the training each year with aspirations to become professional footballers. On average, around 500 players who have been trained consistently in this program join each weekend. Each month, the group welcomes around 40-50 new players. ThaiBev wants the ThaiBev Football Academy to be a foundational project that trains quality professional players for the Thai football leagues.

In addition to its youth support, ThaiBev has also supported professional football in Thailand for the past 20 years, helping to strengthen the industry. Due to these efforts, Thai football has achieved the highest net worth among Southeast Asian countries. The professional football clubs have their standards improved, enjoy large and authentic fan bases, and the teams are well paid and stable. ThaiBev is recognized as an organization that provides uninterrupted support “not just to Thai football, but Thai people as a whole.” ThaiBev is a recognized leader in supporting the Thai football industry.

# Chang Mobile Football Clinic

This mobile football clinic is the first in Thailand. It has aimed to improve young rural football players’ skills for the past 7 years. The training is similar to the ThaiBev Football Academy, but the differences are in its accessibility to youth in remote areas, and the capabilities of youth in each area. The average training session does not exceed 2 hours per day and the whole clinic lasts for 1 - 3 days.

Some training sessions last more than 1 day. These are typically in difficult-to-access remote areas including remote districts in Lao PDR so opportunity must be exploited to the fullest. Coaches need time to prepare their training sessions because of the different skill levels among the young players. Therefore, teams and coaches travel to these areas early to visit community leaders and learn more about constraints young players face, and to prepare the training space and discuss training plans. Local football associations can later deploy these plans as appropriate training exercises for players in their areas.

The Chang Mobile Football Clinic is organized 20 times per year with an allocated budget for a period of 3 - 8 training days. The training plan follows international standards of Small Side Game Football, and the sessions are adjusted according to the skill levels of the players.

Currently, the Chang Mobile Football Clinic is a standard prototype for youth clinics and is highly regarded in different regions. ThaiBev receives collaboration and supports from both public and private sectors to strengthen and sustain the project. The company aims to launch the clinics nationwide, across Thailand’s 77 provinces, in 2022 and expand by 2 to 4 trainings each month depending on the season (including rainy season). However, it also depends on the timeframe and the demand of local communities.

# Chang Football Community

Football community is building a football network for regional youth. ThaiBev uses this program, which is a continued program from Chang Mobile Football Clinic, to help build football knowledge and train young footballers in the following 5 communities:

- Baan Pu Peoy, Nam Yuen District, Ubon Ratchathani Province
- Baan Mae Mok, Krut Sub-district, Kanchanadit District, Surat Thani Province
- Chris FC – Doi Mon Cham, Mae Rim District, Chiang Mai Province
- Hin Khone Academy – Baan Hin Kone, Kap Choeng District, Surin Province
- Baan Karuna Juvenile Delinquency Center, Samut Prakan Province

These 5 locations were selected based on the good collaboration and the needs of the community. Criteria include:

1. Community personnel and community program operators give their budgets, time, etc. to provide training to young children in the area, free of charge. They conduct these training sessions after school and use school area in the local community as a training center. School directors and training center directors must also consistently provide collaboration.

2. The community can be strengthened through using football as a medium to develop young footballers into professionals. This can also help to improve social issues in society. Some communities are able to establish the center as an academy and welcome youth to continue training such as in Chris FC Mon Cham and Hin Khone Academy.

3. The Baan Karuna Juvenile Delinquency Center in Samut Prakan was established to reduce violence and introduce different ways of life so that wayward youth feel more hopeful. The program brought in successful and famous football players to discuss ways of living to young children and to train them in recreational football. The Baan Karuna Juvenile Delinquency Center program has been converted into the Chang Football Community. Collaboration continues annually by providing the mobile clinic here.

ThaiBev also consistently provides practice equipment, beverages for trainings, and other skill support to youth players, coaches and teams. This program not only gives young children chances, but also aims to build a strong and sustainable community.

# Assumption College Thonburi’s White Elephant Project

ThaiBev has partnered with Assumption College Thonburi to help aspiring players achieve their dreams of becoming professionals. For the past 10 years, ThaiBev has built quality players in Thailand at professional, national, and international levels. The White Elephant Project at Assumption College Thonburi is a famous youth football academy that is widely regarded for consistently producing successful professional players.

- Each year an average of 20-25 players graduate from Assumption College Thonburi’s White Elephant Project and 90% of these players enter professional leagues. More than 250 professional players have been produced in the past decade with ThaiBev’s support.

- White Elephant Project of Assumption College Thonburi Program has consistently improved and has become a place to annually groom professional players. Many players from this program are regularly selected for national leagues at different age levels (14/16/18 years old). Strong support from the school director and the White Elephant Program director has helped it expand to other operations.

# Athletic Development

## Len Mai Lerk Campaign*

- "Chang Beverage," in collaboration with the Football Association of Thailand, and under the Patronage of His Majesty the King, launched the campaign "Len Mai Lerk" to cheer on and boost morale for the Thai National Team on their road to the World Cup 2022. The campaign includes a budget to help cheer on the team by giving prizes to every score and goal that may happen from the competition. The motto is: "If Chang Suek does not give up, Chang Suek No. 12 will not stop cheering." The campaign aims to continue with directions and plans appropriate to situations amidst the development of Thai football.

- ThaiBev has a budget for football players and teams when they create impressive works. The company also produces Chang Suek 12 shirts for employees and other personnel to cheer for the Thai National Team at every match and to wear on different occasions to show their support.

- ThaiBev supports PR news for the Thai National Team for public through the company’s media, including on Thai Talent Facebook, the website, or any other print media that ThaiBev is engaged in.

- ThaiBev collaborates with the Football Association of Thailand to support the Youth Team. It established Football Funding for Youth in 2016. The program plans to continue for 10 years. This is how ThaiBev builds people. The goal is to remind people to "never give up" (or 'Len Mai Lerk') until Thai football reaches glory. The past performance has been satisfactory.

- ThaiBev receives support from all personnel in the Thai football industry at all levels. About 500 of them joined the campaign launch. Support came from more than 7,000 ThaiBev staff and the public.

*Len Mai Lerk means never give up.

## Basketball

Basketball is an internationally popular sport that requires speed, accuracy, and strength. Decision making and swift body movement also make basketball the perfect sport for body coordination. ThaiBev has been supporting basketball in Thailand for 8 years, in particular at the youth level, seeking to pave the way for developing professional players.

In addition to providing budget, ThaiBev also works with the Hi-tech Basketball Club, offering a clinic within schools for youth players 4 times a year. Each year, more than 600 aspiring young players participate, which is the maximum number coaches and professional players of Hi-tech Club can take care of. Famous national players take part in the training to inspire young players. Last year, the Hi-tech Professional Team delivered an outstanding performance by winning championships in every league.

# Figure Skating and Speed Skating

Figure skating is an international sport that is relatively unfamiliar to Thais, but with its challenge, hardship, and beauty, aspiring Thai skaters increasingly are interested in the sport and entering competitions. The record shows excellent results among Thai figure skaters and speed skaters in ASEAN, across Asia, and at global levels. Thai figure skaters won 2 gold medals at the SEA Games in 2017 and 2018.

In 2020, players won a chance to participate in the Winter Olympics in Switzerland. ThaiBev has been supporting these 2 types of skating for 8 years, determined not just to win awards and medals but also to produce skilled skaters who can perhaps become future coaches and judges on the global stage as well.

# Athletic Development During COVID-19

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the sport industry has been impacted at every level and in every sport. Professional competitions and activities have been cancelled or delayed.

1. **Publish information on the “Train at Home” system** in online media, including YouTube and “Thai Talent Facebook,” to build understanding and learn new athletic techniques, and promote sport science knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Athletic Development

## Insights

I am always satisfied and happy to work with ThaiBev to develop youth football because I see their sincerity and devotion. ThaiBev understands and operates systematically and most importantly, unceasingly, which is important to develop football as a sustainable sport...I do not wish to waste anyone’s time and budget without devotion. Being a player is likewise. It is about how to always meet the standard. If you are a player, you must have discipline, devotion to practice, an understanding of the game, good teamwork, and high goals. Everyone can find success that way.

**Wittaya Laohakul (Coach Heng)**  
Former National Team Player / Former Development President of FA Thailand / Current - Development President of Chonburi FC



For me, being a volleyball player has helped me learn about losing and winning, being part of a team, helping and supporting each other, and most important, having friendships with my colleagues. I want to pass on all my experiences to my juniors and help them become professional players. This is similar to the opportunity I had from elders and from ThaiBev, which has continuously supported and promoted Thai volleyball.

The festivities were held as a "Virtual Online Celebration" due to the continued COVID-19 outbreak. Participants included the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of ASEAN countries, ambassadors of ASEAN countries, the media, and the general public.

Songs that were selected to be performed as music videos were:
1. The ASEAN Way, the regional anthem.
2. ASEAN as One, a new song composed by C asean Consonant, which was meant to offer encouragement and promote unity among ASEAN citizens.

Both music videos were broadcasted on Facebook and other social media channels so that they could broadly reach the people of ASEAN.

### Social media reach of the 2 music videos:

| Metric            | Value  |
|-------------------|--------|
| Total reach       | 36,072 |
| Total engagement  | 3,742  |
| Total views       | 19,788 |

# Commitments and Achievements

## Development of artwork under the concept of sustainable development

The Bangkok Art Biennale (BAB) 2020 not only propelled the growth of Thailand’s art world, but also allowed Thailand to step up as a leading art fair organizer, attracting press, art-related businesspeople, tourists, and students from Thailand and abroad. These were the driving force of the social event, generating income for businesses in the areas around the significant sites in Bangkok, particularly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The hosting of BAB 2020 played a significant part in stimulating the economy and helped the tourism industry in Thailand to recover.

### The Bangkok Art Biennale (BAB) 2020 also emphasized the importance of the environment. The event’s objectives in this area were as follows:

- **Implementing proper waste management during the event**, e.g. providing receptacles for plastic bottles, which were collected to be recycled, **with the goal to process the used PET bottles into PET fibers that can be made into products such as blankets.**

- **The “BAB x UN SDGs” project** invited artists to learn about various waste management processes and making art from waste. **This created added value and raised awareness about the issue of waste and environmental conservation.**

- **The “Mango COVID” campaign supported local farmers by purchasing 12 tons of mangos** that were in oversupply and were decomposing. BAB artists were asked to create art using the mangos, **as a way of bringing awareness to the issue and encouraging people to buy local fruits** so that the produce was not left to decompose and generate waste.

- **Reducing the transportation of large pieces of artwork from overseas by 50%**, decreasing the number from 50 pieces to 25 pieces, **in order to minimize carbon emissions from transport.**

In the arts and culture section of the Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) 2020, a network of BAB 2020 artists and curators was linked up to showcase their work made from waste materials to address environment-related issues.

**Phra Brahmapundit, Buddhist Chief Abbot of Wat Prayurawongsawat Worawihan**

The importance of organizing art and culture (religion)-related activities together with the community towards sustainable development.

The organization of the Grand Festival Commemorating the Anniversary of Wat Prayurawongsawat Worawihan was a model of management that brought about community participation in 3 interlinking aspects, which is called “Bowon.” These 3 aspects are the “home,” the definition of which refers to the community, Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation and various organizations; the “temple,” which means not only the Buddhist temples, but also other religious places of Christianity or Islam; and the “state,” referring to public schools and government agencies. These 3 parties banded together to reflect the dynamic cooperation in continuously building and developing the community. Recently, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed for the “Uniting for the Development of Kadi Chin Community” project. The partnership is comprised of Wat Prayurawongsawat Worawihan, Foundation for Institute of Social Enterprise Development (FINSEDT), Pracharath Rak Samakee (Thailand) Co., Ltd., Institute of Smart Community Innovation (ISCI), C asean, and Bangkok Art Biennale Foundation. The objective is to develop the community as an enterprise in a concrete manner, to have the community become a model for smart community management, creative economic development through artistic and cultural processes, and sustainability. The community is strengthened through fostering “Bowon” cooperation, becoming an exemplar of urban community development. In this endeavor, Wat Prayurawongsawat Worawihan serves as the cultural hub of the Thai residents in the Kadi Chin community in Thonburi district, which is known for being a community of 3 religions and 4 faiths, specifically, Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Despite their different beliefs, the community has lived together in harmony since the Thonburi period and is considered one of Bangkok’s oldest historic areas.

In July 2018, I had the opportunity to attend the opening of the exhibition “Celebrating the National Glass Plate Negatives Registered as UNESCO Memory of the World” at the National Gallery on Chao Fa Road, Bangkok. I personally am interested in and admire film photography because of how it can evoke emotion and has depth. Photography is an art; it depends on the perspective, and each person’s perspective is different. You can control all the elements yourself when taking a picture. Glass plate negatives produce sharp images, depicting the mood of the era—it looks grand. It is a national heritage. This exhibition was special as I curated the sequence of images, emphasizing categories of photographs that showed the changes in old Siam in various aspects, particularly as Western culture began to integrate into the Siamese way of life. The images mostly show the country’s progress. We were able to draw out the story and make accessible connections, so that the images can tell a story in a way that you can relate to them. They are an important cultural heritage of Thailand that has its own life and numerous stories. Every photograph has a story hidden in it, and it’s fun to look at, which is also important. The clarity of the glass plate negatives and the quality of the images are also considered a national heritage that should be preserved and passed on.

The concept of the international contemporary art festival Bangkok Art Biennale (BAB) 2020 that was announced in November 2019 was “Escape Routes.” As the global situation fell into crisis, the festival invited artists to jointly reflect and discover ways of escaping. The COVID-19 pandemic made the “Escape Routes” theme even more challenging for both the artists and the organizer, as there were many art festivals this year, and after the lockdown, a difficult decision had to be made to organize BAB 2020 as planned. The COVID-19 situation made it risky. So we asked the artists whether they still wanted to go on with the show, and the responses that we received were positive. That became one of the main reasons that we decided to go ahead with the festival. We believed that the artists were now viewing the world differently and their work could offer compassion, understanding, and caring, which are all so essential in these times.

We hoped that BAB 2020 could survive all these challenges. What made us able to pull through was the spirit and enthusiasm of all 82 artists, who were determined to make BAB 2020 happen. The team of curators and the management team also did excellent work. The event wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for the flexibility, resiliency, and determination of the BAB 2020 team.

BAB 2020: ESCAPE ROUTES in the “New Normal”



The nation’s artistic and cultural heritage is as valuable and important as natural heritage as it is the unique trait that indicates the social identity of each country. In addition, art and culture also serve as important evidence of the national history and prosperity from past to present. Not only is it the longstanding prestige of the country, it is also another vital resource in national development, particularly with regards to tourism, generating massive income for the country each year.

In keeping up with the global current, the country must develop under a balanced framework of economics, technology, and infrastructure, together with the preservation and safeguarding of the national cultural heritage in all fields, in order to maintain its authenticity and original identity. Development under these principles will then be sustainable and stable as we move forward into the future. If we develop without considering our country’s cultural heritage, this would be equal to severing the very heart of our nation. The country may thrive in terms of materialism grounded in economics and technology, but our national identity with its longstanding history will have dissipated and become meaningless. The prestige of the nation on the world stage would regress, even if we were to have economic or military stability.

In today’s world, inter-organizational cooperation is one of the most important things in propelling the success of an organization and of the country. Such cooperation allows many different organizations with expertise in different areas to come together to collaborate and create new things for the country.

ThaiBev has always supported and cooperated with us in creating a new generation of musicians and musical groups that can admirably represent the country at the national level. ThaiBev scholarships are provided to students who have the talent but may not have been given the opportunity. This creates social equity and allows these students to change their entire lives.

Another way in which ThaiBev provides support is in the development of professional orchestras. It’s not about creating a musical group, but fostering hands-on learning from experts to students. This provides the chance to participate in international competitions, fostering the country’s image or branding.

Having proficient professional orchestras showcases the nation’s progress and projects an image that is equal to other countries. The emergence of AI has greatly affected work in many sectors, and organizations need to adapt to this challenge. Creative work may be less affected than other industries, as it still requires human creativity in response to the continuous changes of humanity. Inter-organizational cooperation and support can develop the capacities of individuals. With systems in place to expand upon success and more opportunities to compete, the GDP in terms of the creative economy will progressively grow and generate income for the country in the near future.

# Organizational policies on the implementation and planning of art- and culture-related efforts at ThaiBev

ThaiBev greatly understands the importance of art- and culture-related work, with the realization that arts and culture constitute a strong foundation that clearly showcases the Thai identity that has been passed on from ancient times up until the present day. This is what makes Thailand an outstanding country that is renowned and admired by people all around the world. It is known as a country with both tangible and intangible beauty. Therefore, Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, as a private organization with stability in its business implementation, considers the preservation of national arts and culture as one of its many missions. We are determined to put all our efforts into giving back to the country.

ThaiBev’s implementation strategy in the promotion of arts and culture is comprised of the following 3 principles:

- **Stable growth**: promoting learning and research on local wisdom in art, culture, and traditions from those who have inherited the knowledge from past generations, who can then in turn pass it on to the next generation. This includes the provision of scholarships and sponsorships for music competitions with the Luang Pradit Phairoh (Sorn Silapabanleng) Foundation and lending support to various educational institutions e.g. Silpakorn University, Mahidol University, Princess Galyani Vadhana Institute of Music, etc. to develop individual capacities, knowledge, and expertise in various fields.

## Sustainability

- **Sustainability**: Emphasizes the importance of preserving historical works of art and culture, highlighting collaboration with the private sector and government bodies like the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts Department. This includes restoring ancient sites and mural paintings, and preserving glass plate negatives as a UNESCO Memory of the World.

- **Creating value**: Supports organizations in various art fields, providing financial and technical support to achieve their goals. ThaiBev believes many artists lack opportunities to develop, and thus provides platforms for showcasing talents, emphasizing the creative economy.

ThaiBev has initiated projects like the Water Festival and River Festival, and supports the White Elephant Art Award to promote realistic artwork. The Bangkok Art Biennale (BAB) invites renowned artists to collaborate with Thai artists, offering new wave artists opportunities for international success.

## Moving Forward

ThaiBev aims to support and promote arts and culture, fostering social development in a sustainable way while preserving Thai identity. Arts-related activities connect society to ThaiBev’s social service activities, grounded in three principles: stable growth, sustainability, and creating value. These principles guide the implementation of projects in visual arts, music, performance art, literary art, cultural tradition, and religion, benefiting society by building strength, happiness, and stable growth.



### The strategy is grounded in 3 principles:

- **Stable growth**
- **Sustainability**
- **Creating value**

These principles drive the implementation of working groups at national and international levels in various art domains.

# Community Development

From drought in late-2019 to the outbreak of COVID-19, the prices of agricultural products have fallen due to decreasing demand in global markets. At the same time, local fruit farmers in Thailand faced oversupply problems and were directly impacted by lockdown measures. Farmers hit by this abrupt change had no time to prepare for it. Amidst this unprecedented crisis, ThaiBev stepped in to provide aid and support. Community development projects have addressed many of these issues, with goals to improve the local economy through knowledge transferring and vocational training and to improve forest and water resources. These will give choices to farmers to remain self-reliant. In this way, communities can be made more self-sustainable, while serving as models for other areas further on.

### "ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold" Project

The "ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold" project has been underway for 21 years. The project aims to help those vulnerable to coldness in the north and northeast, and involves cooperation from the Ministry of Interior, Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, and provincial governors, including allies from both public and private sectors that increase by year to deliver this warmth. Each year, ThaiBev distributes 200,000 green blankets to communities affected by cold temperatures in the north and northeast. To date, 4.2 million blankets have been delivered to 45 provinces in Thailand. The affected areas are carefully selected so that blankets are not delivered to the same area year after year. More than 80% of those who receive blankets from the "ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold" project enjoy protection from cold temperatures and say that the project has improved their health and livelihood.

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of environmental issues as prominent in a circular economy. So, this year, ThaiBev is delivering eco-friendly blankets. The blankets are fleece made from recycled PET bottles. Some 200,000 blankets reduce waste of up to 7.6 million PET bottles (1 blanket: 38 bottles).

#### Blanket from Recycled PET Bottles

| Item                  | Quantity          |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 blanket             | 38 bottles        |
| Total blankets        | 200,000 blankets  |
| Reduced PET bottles   | 7.6 million PET bottles |

Apart from giving out blankets in the area, ThaiBev also provides support in other aspects:

- **Education**: ThaiBev organizes the "For Kids with Love from ThaiBev" project to give out scholarships to students in every school in the area, along with classroom materials and sports equipment to schools in need.
- **Public health**: With voluntary cooperation from Suandok Hospital and Ruamphaet Yasothon Hospital, a mobile medical unit performs all-in-one health checks using professional staff and medical equipment.
- **The "1 Share, 1 Warm-up" project** provides an opportunity for other parties such as voluntary employees and business partners to donate for 1 blanket to children and youth in vulnerable communities beyond "ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold" project's selection of 15 provinces each year. They also get to provide free lunch, with recreational activities to bring joy, smiles and laughter to the kids.

It gets very cold during winter here. The villagers have to stay by the fire. During the night, they will pile themselves under as many blankets as they can find in order to get warm. Life here is nice. It’s simple and quiet. The only thing we lack is development. The villagers are collaborative. It’s very nice that ThaiBev comes and gives blankets to our folks here. I don’t know how cold it will get this winter. I feel glad for the villagers. I would like to thank ThaiBev on behalf of the residents of every household that receive blankets.

The temperature can drop to 16 Celsius during winter here. Most of the areas here are for agriculture. We lack blankets during winter. Only ThaiBev comes in to donate them to the poor. I feel glad for the villagers who receive these blankets. The poor can really use them to keep themselves warm during cold mornings or to protect themselves from the sun. As a village headman, I would like to express our gratitude. I would like to see ThaiBev continue giving out blankets to the poor.

The project started by reviving a fish conservation area by dredging 680 meters of Klam canal, with 16,000 cubic meters of soil being dredged up. This maintained a water level suitable for fish conservation during dry season, and helped manage and store water in the canal for later consumption and agriculture. To date, the number of fish farmers with a large farm of Chumpon-strain climbing perch (Pla mo) has grown to 43 farmers. The production volume is 900 kilograms per farm, with earnings of 63,000 baht per farm. As for the operation based on the New Theory of Agriculture, a new water distribution system has been developed to use less water in Ban Wangsriprai village, Dong Duai, Kong Krailat, Sukhothai. To date, the utilization on the New Theory of Agriculture has been expanded to 5 cases on a 9-rai plot of land. As a result, expenses have decreased to 2,000 baht per month while incomes have increased to 10,000 baht per month.

## "Rehabilitation for Victims of Landslide and Mudslide" project, Ban Huai Khap village, Nan Province

Ban Hai Khap village, Moo 7, Bo Kluea Nuea was affected by a landslide and mudslide on 27 July 2018. The disaster included fatalities, and 61 houses belonging to 66 families were destroyed. Since landslides and mudslides can recur, villagers and related sectors agreed upon moving the community to another piece of land. ThaiBev cooperated with the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, Community Organizations Development Institute, and partner agencies in Nan province. A budget was provided to construct 60 houses for 247 affected residents. Moreover, ThaiBev also helped improve villagers’ livelihoods by outlining improvement plans to promote a sufficient economy, boost the local economy, and conserve and restore the cultural heritage of the Lua ethnic group.

# Community Development

## Promoting “A Good Community with Smile” Project for New Generation

ThaiBev provided a budget and a working team who work in community development for “A Good Community with Smile” project to visit the area and drive the project. Reaping benefits from new generation who return to their hometown, it marked an expansion from the “Unite for Our Hometown” project. Young people seeking to improve local business are key to the cooperation with other sectors to bring happiness and smile back to their hometown, and also to achieve sustainable benefits in all aspects. The main goal is to solve problems and drive the local economy in accordance with the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and to expand the goal to include general sustainable development. By emphasizing district and provincial cooperation, the community is encouraged to participate in the work to promote social, economic, and environmental benefits based on each community’s needs and potentials.

## Example Models of “A Good Community with Smile”

### A Good Community with Smile at Laem Sing, Chanthaburi Province

**Community-based tourism development project at “Ban Pla - Thanakarn Pu” Nature & Environment Learning Center**

The “Ban Pla - Thanakarn Pu” Nature & Environment Learning Center is located in Bang Sa Kao, Laem Sing. It was founded in response to mangrove forest encroachment. Since mangrove forests are nursing habitats for fish and a local resource for food, an assembly was formed to conserve these resources with plans to develop a learning center and tourist attraction in the community.

A Good Community with Smile at Laem Sing supported the community to establish a working team with a clear management guideline and involved partners agencies to develop and fulfill the community’s potential by spotlighting local fisherman’s way of life, local handicraft known as reed mats (Suea kok), and remarkable local dishes to promote ecotourism and local ways of life. The traditional occupation of weaving reed mats has also been developed to produce new types of products to meet market demand and create more value.

Moreover, the community shop “Laem Sing’s Good Community with Smile” selling local products opened under the community’s management. A homestay-style of hospitality service was also developed to welcome tourists and provide a further opportunity to generate income.

# A Good Community with Smile at Khong Chiam, Ubon Ratchathani Province

## Mekong Organic Cotton Development Project, Cotton Network at Khong Chiam

Ban Khan Tha Kwian village in Khong Chiam, Ubon Ratchathani is a great cotton plantation area near the Mekong River due to its abundant natural resources. Villagers plant cotton there during low tide without using chemicals, then collect and spin it into yarn, which will be woven by hand afterwards. Knowledge to produce this traditional handicraft is on the verge of disappearance. As it requires a long time to process the cotton by hand, villagers sell cotton flowers to the factory instead.

A Good Community with Smile at Khong Chiam has developed the community’s capability and understanding in terms of producing and weaving cotton, which kick-started a cotton network of 6 communities in Khong Chiam district. The cotton fund was provided along with a large cotton gin so that the communities can use and sell their own equipment. This reduces the cost of and time involved in producing handmade cotton. This also encouraged the development of cotton products, such as natural-color handmade cotton yarn, scarves, shawls, and other decorative products. The initiative will add value and new marketing channels to generate more income for the community.

In addition, a related project of community-based tourism under the name ESAN COTTON VILLAGE aims to expand the results to nearby communities by focusing on the distinctive identity of the Mekong organic cotton flower and the knowledge required for traditional cotton weaving.

### Beneficiaries

- Members of 6 communities, consisting of 100 people

### Income

- The community earned 363,825 baht in income as a result

# A Good Community with Smile at Yang Talat, Kalasin Province

## Fabric Workers Network Project

Ban Non Chat village in Yang Talat, Kalasin is a community with a rich tradition of weaving. However, it has faced issues related to marketing and a lack of diverse products. Therefore, A Good Community with Smile at Yang Talat project supported the village by connecting communities with experts in weaving, sewing, and design. The 6 communities formed a network of fabric workers in Ban Non Chat, Ban Dong Bang, Ban Nong Kung, Ban Nong Kao, Ban Huai Toei, and Ban Phon Ngam, expanding from Yang Talat district to other districts in Kalasin province.

A Good Community with Smile at Yang Talat project connected the woven fabric network with Maha Sarakham province and Amnat Charoen province. This helped members (112 people in total) find jobs and careers. Moreover, a wide variety of products have been developed, including shirts, tote bags, key chains, briefcases, and more. As a result, orders and incomes continue to grow in the community.

### Beneficiaries

- 112 beneficiaries: Members of fabric weaving and processing in 6 communities, consisting of 78 people
- Members of fabric network, consisting of 34 people

### Income

- The community earned 814,283 baht in income as a result

## Insights

**Wannee Pilanont**  
Member of the Ban Khan Tha Kwian Weaving Group

Our weaving group used to make only woven scarves with cotton from factories. The width was only 32 centimeters so the cost per piece was cheap. We hoped people would buy them at a cheaper price. It turned out that we couldn’t sell any of them. We had to consign them to the sales representatives and ran into trouble as the funds decreased. We couldn’t purchase factory cotton everyday anymore. We had to wait for the sales representatives to sell those scarves for us to have any money to continue weaving.

After joining A Good Community with Smile at Khong Chiam project, we shifted to handmade cotton from our community’s Mekong cotton instead. The cost is higher but it is unique to our village. We changed the weaving beater with the width of 32 to 40 centimeters. The fabric is bigger and gets more attention from customers. We started to have multiple channels to distribute our products. Sale representatives are no longer needed. We sell it ourselves or sometimes tourists come to buy them. We sell the products faster than we used to. Now we make fabric with various widths, woven from our very own handmade Mekong cotton. And we can make enough money now from customer orders, so we’re able to weave everyday.



“I’m glad that ThaiBev helped us develop hand-woven fabric products, allowing the group to learn about color matching, pattern making, group management, and experiment with many dyeing techniques. The group also learned to make connections with multiple sectors related to providing necessary support, building awareness, and marketing. Many new products have been developed. New knowledge is shared among group members. Thank you, ThaiBev, for helping our group to develop, connect with local sectors, and increase the income in community.”

## ThaiBev’s Forest Conservation Program with the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center to Improve Quality of Life in Nan Province

With collaboration from the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center, ThaiBev has utilized His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s development model to restore watershed forests and improve quality of life for the locals living around degraded forest areas, so they live self-sustainably and harmoniously with nature. The model has been applied to areas in Nan province after it proved successful in Doi Saket, Chiang Mai province. 2 villages were chosen for the project: Sinapan village, Rueang municipality, in Mueang Nan district and Nam Poon village, Nam Pang municipality, in Mae Charim district. The villagers follow the principles of HM King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy.

In a span of 5 years (2015-2019), ThaiBev has brought the community to learn about livestock, agriculture, and fisheries at the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center, so they could adapt it to their own community. ThaiBev also provided various materials for domestication, planting, and daily consumption; these included three species of pigs, Thai black-tailed chickens, hens, frogs, catfish, tilapia, mushrooms, and fruit seedlings. ThaiBev encourages farmers to standardize their agricultural activities according to the academic standard and expand their results into an effective learning center for interested public.

The amount of money is a guideline for buying necessities to be given out to qualified farmers, according to assessment by Huai Hong Khrai Center.

## 2019

Model farmers were given grades, budgets and provided factors worth **30,000 baht per person**.

From 2015-2019 when the projects operated, the model farmers were selected from the continuing farmers in both villages, by the ThaiBev team and Huai Hong Khrai Center.

## 2020

Following up on the selection of model farmers in both communities to create a learning center in 2021 for:

- **4 farmers** from Srinapan village, Moo 1, Rueang, Mueang Nan District, Nan province
- **4 farmers** from Nam Poon village, Moo 1, Nam Phang, Mae Charim, Nan province

**Sangchan Saket**  
Villager of Rueang, Mueang Nan District, Nan Province

My livelihood is better after participating in the project and I’ve gained new knowledge from the Huai Hong Khrai Center, and received support from ThaiBev. My income has also increased from factors such as building materials, animal breeds such as pigs, chickens, hens, catfish, tilapia, fruit seedlings; this has resulted in lower household expenses and more savings. We can grow and breed our own animals and distribute them at a good price, giving the family another channel for income. I would like to thank ThaiBev for this project. It would be nice to have projects like this in other communities, so they have similar opportunities.

# Community Development

## Insight

In 2015, the headman announced that ThaiBev had a project to help our village. I signed up to join the course of raising frogs. At first, I was unable to breed them until I learned from the Huai Hong Krai Center. After that, I could breed frogs successfully. They have a high rate of reproduction, so I made a lot of money selling tadpoles, frog meat, and processing them into chili paste and grilled frogs. I would like to express my appreciation to ThaiBev and the Huai Hong Krai Center for providing great opportunities to our community. I wish that a good project like this can be expanded to other communities so they can lead a good life like us.

## Community-based Tourism Project: Following the Footsteps of Luang Pu Man Phurithatto

![Food offering to monks along Tham Road, Wat Phurithattawat, Sakon Nakhon](image)

ThaiBev, in collaboration with Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation and the Department of Community Development, Ministry of Interior, recognizes the importance of celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Luang Pu Man Phurithatto, who was honored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a key figure of world peace in 2020-2021. His 150th anniversary was celebrated on January 20, 2020. And since he traveled to various regions in central, northern, and northeastern Thailand, and also to neighboring countries, there was an opportunity to organize a community-based tourism project to follow in his footsteps. People can travel and learn about the history, his routine and conduct, and his teachings. Moreover, it also encourages collaboration between houses, temples, and schools under the principle of “Bovorn” (superb/glorious), and a chance to promote community enterprises, organizations, and government services that are in accordance with the faithful. Such collaborations aim to boost the local economy via community-based tourism and to distribute that income to enterprises, shops, restaurants, homestays, product manufacturers, and souvenir shops in the community. These, eventually, can be developed further into new social enterprises.

In the community-based tourism project “Following the Footsteps of Luang Pu Man Phurithatto,” there are 12 provinces participating with 35 main destinations, consisting of 4 main areas:

- **Central region**: Lopburi, Nakhon Nayok, and Bangkok
- **Northern region**: Chiang Mai
- **Upper Northeastern region**: Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Nong Khai, Udon Thani, Nong Bua Lamphu, and Loei
- **Lower Northeastern region**: Ubon Ratchathani and Amnat Charoen

This will help generate sustainable income for the community and open up economic opportunities for community-based tourism as well. For more details, please visit www.luangpuman-cbt.org

12 provinces and 35 destinations were visited. 6 touristic routes were created in:
1. Chiang Mai
2. Lop Buri
3. Nakhon Nayok
4. Ubon Ratchathani - Amnat Charoen
5. Sakon Nakhon - Nakhon Phanom
6. Udon Thani - Loei - Nong Khai - Nong Bua Lamphu

With 35 communities participating (1 community per destination), and in the beginning, generated over 90,000 baht for the communities.

## Sapai Sainaew Project
### (Local cloth for bags and straps)

Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and its networks including the Thailand Textile Institute visited local communities and offered training on textiles, formats, colors, and value-added techniques to enrich the value of “Yaam” (Thai rucksack) for consumers. Famous national designers such as ASAVA Tube Gallery also volunteered, along with other local designers. They sought to improve formats, textile techniques, processing methods, and marketing. The ultimate goal is to generate sustainable revenue for the community.

Additionally, distribution channels increased to reach more domestic and international consumers. The project also participated in events such as the OTOP exhibition, Baanlaesuan Fair, and Hong Kong Fashion Week & Trade Fair 2019. Online channels include the “SaraphadSaphpasilp” Facebook and Instagram pages. The products won favorable reviews from producers and consumers, and Thai Yaam became popular among the new generation. This inevitably helped with community growth. Participating members in the project currently consist of 3,064 people from 39 communities in 18 provinces nationwide. The total accumulative revenue for the communities is 15,785,311 baht. This year alone generated revenue of 5,571,195 baht for the community.

# Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Store

The store is located at CW Tower, Ratchadapisek Road, Huay Kwang, Bangkok. The store was established as a central exhibition center to permanently distribute local products from Pracharath Rak Samakkee Network. Besides selling in the store and through a Facebook page, prsthaiand.official, the store also gets in touch with big organizations to produce made-to-order souvenirs for seminars, activities, and New Year’s baskets.

Currently, Pracharath Rak Samakkee supports more than 159,000 local products from 425 communities, generating total revenue of 15.69 million baht. This year alone generated revenue of more than 5 million baht for the community.

# “Ready-to-Mill” Household Rice Miller Project

The innovation development program, the “Ready-to-Mill,” a household rice miller, has been in operation since 2017. Its aim is to create a supply chain based on a new marketing channel for farmers, one that allows them to sell native rice varieties directly to consumers at a higher price than traditional sales. The initiative also encourages farmers to develop their production skills, including rice drying, selection, packaging, and transportation, in order to ensure quality before delivering products directly to consumers. This creates direct income for the farmers. Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and Natwave Technology Co., Ltd. developed a mutual plan to research, develop, produce, and distribute the first 150 units of household rice miller in 2020. So far, total sales are 148 units. Currently, a prototype of the second model, which is lighter and more compact, is being developed, with a plan to roll it out in October 2021.

# Commitments and Achievements

- The Pracharath Rak Samakkee project developed and distributed local products during the COVID-19 pandemic to help well-equipped communities from the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network nationwide as well as communities from “A Good Community with Smile” Project generate income through product sales on Facebook under the name “Saraphad Sapsinaph” (the name changed from Sapai Sainaew) for 2 months in April and May. Total revenue generated by the 88 participating communities was 3,863,915 baht.

- To date, the “Pracharath Rak Samakkee” network across the country has initiated 1,161 projects in the 3 categories of agriculture, processing, and community-based tourism. Covering 85,064 households, it has generated total revenue of 1,246,120,152 baht for communities. This year alone it generated total income of more than 243 million baht.

- “Hand-woven cloth, Chiang Rai” group who participated in Sapai Sainaew Project was awarded the THAILAND TOP SME AWARDS 2019 in the category of “Excellent Social Enterprise for Local Wisdom.” This award is given to SMEs with outstanding operations that aim to laud, encourage, and develop SMEs to have competitiveness, unique management, and potentials to become role models.

# Moving Forward

During the past year, the Pracharath Rak Samakkee project has continued developing the root economy, which includes 3 steps as follows:

1. **Create foundation and network (2016 – 2019)**  
   This began with the formulation of a network framework and mechanism design through the establishment of the Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise covering all 76 provinces nationwide and the Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. Each province launched practical projects in parallel with national projects. The Business Development Institute for Society Foundation (FINSEDT) was also established to drive social enterprise across the country.

   On 15 November 2019, Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and all 76 Pracharath networks registered as social enterprises according to Clause 6(1) of the Social Enterprise Promotion Act B.E. 2562—“Social enterprise that does not intend to share its profit to equity holders or shareholders”—from the Social Enterprise Promotion Division, Department of Social Development and Welfare, Ministry of Social Development and Human Security.

2. **Create success in every province (2020 – 2022)**  
   Encourage the Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise network in each province to build a model of success in 3 areas, namely agriculture, value-added products, and community-based tourism, and to pass on and exchange know-how to network members. The main goal is to create a business network from the community level to the national level.

   Within 2 years after COVID-19 dwindling down, the project aims to connect all operations from every sector and 50% of the robust provincial Pracharath Rak Samakkee to encourage each community’s potential and drive tangible results, including 1-2 results/province and to scale up the rest in the following year.

3. **Further develop and expand (2023 – 2026)**  
   Create opportunities, transfer know-how, and expand the success of community businesses to national and global levels. Besides expanding to provincial working groups, the project will also connect to the Foundation of Social Enterprise Development of Thailand to gather know-how in various projects for mass distribution through different channels, such as seminars and events, to communicate with domestic and international networks. The goal is to build upon successful cases and to apply their methods to future projects.

This is an ongoing activity following the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) Summit 2019 organized by C asean in partnership with the Foundation for the Institute of Social Enterprise Development (FINSEDT) and the US Embassy of Thailand. This project aims to build the ASEAN youth network to support and develop their communities, thus encouraging young participants to present sustainable development projects in support of social, economic, and environmental aspects through virtual showcases via C asean’s Facebook Page under the theme “Advancing Social Entrepreneurship.” The objective of this project is to empower youth-driven social enterprises in the region. Interesting topics include:

- **Drive Impacts**: Work processes that create significant impacts and generate results that benefit ThaiBev Group and its employees.

A new sustainability award is included in 2020 with the objective to promote understanding on sustainability to participants and judges. Participants present the sustainability angle of their projects, from both ThaiBev and its stakeholders perspectives by referring to UN SDGs.

# Employee Engagement

ThaiBev is determined to be one of the world’s leading organizations and recognizes the importance of employee engagement given that it is one of the best ways to receive employee feedback which can be analyzed for organization improvement, increases in employee engagement, unity, and ability to support employees (in terms of work, well-being, other opportunities, etc.) This year, ThaiBev achieved significant increases in employee engagement from 69% to 85% as a result of collaboration efforts within the organization.

### Employee Engagement

In 2020, ThaiBev Employee Engagement have significantly improved from previous year:

   - **Stay** – Employees have strong bonds and long-term commitments to the organization.
   - **Strive** – Employees are determined to bring their best performance to the organization.

2. **Employee apprehensions towards various indicators and topics**, such as organizational visions, safety and wellbeing, work values, supervisors, internal communications, compensation and benefits, etc.

![Beverest Life Application](#)

# Preparing for Future through Digital Experience

ThaiBev focuses on the development of digital technology for all employees, and of all ages, with the objective to create fast and efficient work. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ThaiBev adopted Work from Home (WFH) with digital technology that helps employees work effectively from anywhere. For instance, trainings are provided for digital tools like Zoom or MS Teams so everyone works smoothly and conducts meetings seamlessly. Moreover, ThaiBev also utilized a digital check-in system to record attendance together with tracking employees who live or work in at-risk areas. The digital check-in system has also been added to facilities, so that when employees return they can avoid unnecessary contact from finger-scanning machines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

# Career-based Development

ThaiBev designs job families according to their functions, provides opportunities for employees to progress, defines career paths, improves capacities, and recognizes people’s individual development plans in order to systematically develop employees and help them to advance their careers, as outlined in the following:

1. **Employee Development and Opportunity Building**
   - To develop their capacity to perform their roles and responsibilities efficiently and receive pertinent opportunities to advance in the organization.
   - Employees are divided into groups by job level, such as Spring & Streams (operational), River (management), and Ocean (executives). ThaiBev develops employee potential, according to the 70:20:10 formula:

     | Learning by Doing | Learning from Others | Learning from Formal Training |
     |-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
     | 70%               | 20%                  | 10%                           |

   - The development program is divided into 4 types, as follows:

     | Core Competency | General Skills |
     |-----------------|----------------|
     | Functional Competency | Leadership Competency |

2. **Development Evaluation**
   - Uses the Kirkpatrick Training Evaluation Model to develop the capacity of employees with outstanding potential through learning programs tailored to different levels, from high-level executives to supervisor-level employees.

3. **Individual Development Plan (IDP)**
   - Covers 100% of employees from officer to executive levels (4 and above), in order to improve their weaknesses and enhance their strengths, and to prepare them to progress to a higher level within their job families. This also includes follow-up programs to ensure that the plan has been implemented effectively and is achieving its goals. In this regard, ThaiBev has achieved 100% of its goals.

   - The processes to develop IDP for employees in job families include:
     1. Analysis of a career path and required competency in designated job families
     2. Evaluates potential in job families in order to identify competency gaps
     3. Develops IDP from evaluation results and career goals in designated job families through Beverest, which is ThaiBev’s human capital information technology.

   - IDP is also developed for employees at other levels from other job families. For instance, supervisors create IDP through Beverest to track planned advancement.

4. **Functional Training Program**
   - Was launched in 2019 for employees from 3 job families, including sales, finance and accounting, and human resources. This covers career opportunities for 5,400 employees.

   - **Career Opportunities for 5,400 employees**

# Talent Development Program

Talent development programs are designed to support and enhance the capacity of employees at every level through Learner Centric Principle, and by promoting their business knowledge and leadership skills by applying the 70:20:10 formula and the “Learning by Doing” concept and Action-Learning Project. The programs serve as a platform for employees to present their ideas to help ThaiBev achieve its visions, allowing ThaiBev executives to see employee potentials. This is a more effective way of learning than formal learning alone, for instance, these projects include Supervisory Development Program (SDP), Management Development Program (MDP), ASEAN Management Development (AMD), and Senior Executive Development Program (SEDP), in which high-level executives participate in events and give feedback in order to develop ideas from case studies to implementation.

Additionally, ThaiBev has developed Leadership Competency Development Guidebook to assist the selection of development activities under the 70:20:10 formula and to support the development of Individual Development Plan (IDP).

# Goals towards PASSION 2025

In order to be ready for a new set of goals in 2025, which business change rapidly due to digital technology and automation, it is necessary for ThaiBev to develop and equip employees with the capacity to respond and adapt to changes through the development of their skills, both “ReSkill” and “UpSkill.”

### 2. Global Summit of Women 2020

ThaiBev donated 100,000 US dollars in support to the Global Summit of Women 2020 as Thailand was honored to host the summit under the theme: “Women Revolutionizing Economies.” This summit brought together talented businesswomen from more than 70 countries to discuss interesting topics, and share experiences and perspectives toward work and female leadership. This international summit links businesspersons, professionals, and management executives from public, private, and social sectors to build a collaboration network and share experiences to expand business opportunities and promote sustainable global economic development. This year celebrates the 30th anniversary of the summit. It is an opportune moment to reinforce Thailand’s positive image on the global stage and highlight Thailand’s recognition of female roles in its business sectors, as they are a major force in mobilizing economic and social development, both at national and international levels.

# Consumer Health and Safety

The health problem remains a major problem for the world population today. According to the World Health Organization, the majority of the death may be caused by non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, vascular disease, heart disease and cancer. It is estimated that chronic non-communicable diseases kill 75% of all Thai deaths, of which 55% occurred in people under 70 years of age. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic affected consumers’ confidence and concerns on health and safety of products and services.

## Insight

**Suvit Sirichu**  
Vice President - Operations (Shabushi and Nikuya)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shabushi and Nikuya restaurants embraced new safety measures and adjusted their business operations to promote safety and consumer confidence. Shabushi and Nikuya both followed government regulations and recommendations, including using the ThaiChana (Thai government’s location check-in application), adhering to physical distancing measures, performing temperature checks at all entry points, and installing signage to encourage mask wearing. During the lockdown, Shabushi adjusted its business model, which previously featured 99% dine-in services, by increasing online delivery through LINE MAN, Grab, and foodpanda. Shabushi staff also delivered food directly to customers.

KFC has adjusted its model from dine-in to takeaway and delivery without zone restriction in delivery services of each branch since April 2020. This applies only to customers who ordered directly online. This adjustment has helped KFC to cover more customers and respond to the needs of customers who are not in delivery zone or are too far from the branches. This has made it more convenient for them.

# Customer Relationship Management

ThaiBev values the satisfaction of its customers and sales agents. Since they are ThaiBev’s main stakeholders, they are key factors in the business’ success. ThaiBev has initiated projects to help develop customer capacity and work closely with them as business consultants to help grow sales and increase their satisfaction in working with ThaiBev.

## Care and Assistance during COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic led the government to prohibit sales of alcohol and to close shopping malls and full-service restaurants. This caused business disruptions and created unique challenges. ThaiBev needed to instill confidence in its customers as a partner of good will. ThaiBev has helped customers address this situation through the following activities:

- Created videos to provide knowledge on health and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in an easy-to-understand format and shared it with 280 customers nationwide through online networks at the start of the pandemic.
- Invited sales agents in Bangkok and vicinity to receive COVID-19 screening tests at ThaiBev’s COVID-19 center to ensure their health and peace of mind during the pandemic.
- Provided COVID-19 insurance valued at 100,000 baht to 6,163 sales agents and family members.

# Customer Relationship Management

In addition to assisting customers, 2,400 ThaiBev staff responsible for 280,000 retail shops nationwide started COVID-19 preventive measures in mid-February 2020. These measures aimed to build customer confidence by wearing masks and gloves, sanitizing with alcohol gel, and reducing infection risks during operations, such as product delivery and cash payments.

Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery unit of Sermsuk Public Company Limited provided delivery services to consumers in Bangkok and nearby areas as the government ordered citizens to self-quarantine at home. Customers could purchase products like Crystal Drinking Water, est Cola, and OISHI Green Tea.

## BevFood Application

ThaiBev developed the BevFood application as an extension of the OISHI Pointo application for customers and restaurant staff. It allows rapid access to information in response to changing consumer behavior for convenience and speed.

BevFood now has over 400,000 members. Users can manage membership accounts, collect points for e-voucher redemption (1 point for every 25 baht spent), and receive other privileges and promotions via e-coupons. BevFood also allows advance reservations and provides up-to-date information.

In 2020, BevFood was applicable to restaurants of more than ten brands, with plans to expand coverage to other brands in the future.

# Commitments and Achievements

## Customer Evaluations, Tracking and Satisfaction Assessments
ThaiBev seeks to build strong relationships with customers for their highest satisfaction. ThaiBev evaluates, tracks, and assesses customer satisfaction annually by external parties per international standards and principles. ThaiBev uses the results from the satisfaction surveys to identify indicators to assess performance of ThaiBev’s teams that work with customers. Each year, ThaiBev sets higher customer satisfaction targets to drive for continuous improvement.

## Consumer Behavior Analysis System
The food business collaborates with CMKL University, which was founded in cooperation between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, to develop consumer behavior analysis systems to evaluate actual services in all channels creating direct-sale opportunities that serve customers’ needs. This helps to maintain customer base, effectively acquiring new customer groups, and expand the customer base for other ThaiBev’s restaurant brands in the future.



# Insights

Everyone has been affected by COVID-19. We have had to manage the situation conscientiously. During the shutdown period, ThaiBev regularly visited us to provide alcohol gel and masks. They were concerned about agents’ and employees’ health, and asked for updates on our business. We were also concerned about our customers’ health. We distributed alcohol and masks from ThaiBev to our customers. ThaiBev takes care us like family.

**Wanpen Wanchalee**

I have to admit that COVID-19 has caused us to adjust how we address challenging circumstances. We have been working together just like family for so long. We have been through other hardships together, such as the floods in 2011.

We thank the executives for providing masks and alcohol gel, which are items in greatly needed. We distributed them to agents and all of them appreciated the help. The amount given to use were enough to share with their families, staff members, and customers as well. This is how we took good care of each other.

# Customer Relationship Management

## Insight

Last year, online food delivery has expanded more than 100% through our own brands like www.oishidelivery.com or BevFood application, which serve customers conveniently, with one application. Online food delivery plays a major role in people’s daily lives now. The lives of those living in cities have changed, with less home cooking. Other factors such as traffic congestions, distances between homes and restaurants, and the simple convenience of eating at home, together with the wider use of technology in daily life, made online food ordering an attractive alternative for consumers.

Consumer opinions after receiving services are also valuable. A QR Survey system is used to collect information, opinions, suggestions, compliments, and complaints. The restaurants with below standard scores will be notified via email, and improvement measures must be reported. Every opinion is screened and analyzed to develop, improve, and help the organization respond to consumers’ needs faster and more efficiently.

# Serve Responsibly

ThaiBev conducts business by being socially and environmentally responsible throughout the company’s value chain and in accordance with applicable laws. This includes promoting responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages. ThaiBev seeks to increase awareness of business owners and service providers on consumer health and safety by initiating the “Serve Responsibly” campaign targeting alcoholic beverage providers such as hotels and restaurants that are ThaiBev’s business partners in every region.

Alcoholic beverage providers play an important role in ensuring their customers consume alcoholic beverages safely. For instance, they should stop serving customers who appear to be intoxicated, assist intoxicated customers to public transportation, and otherwise take care of intoxicated customers to remain conscious before leaving the premises.

ThaiBev hopes this campaign will be expanded to alert consumers to drink responsibly. In 2020, two types of training were provided:

- **Facebook Page**: ThaiBev created the “Serve Responsibly” Facebook page to promote responsible drinking and to share information and guidelines during COVID-19. The Facebook page currently has 3,200 followers. ThaiBev aims to reach 6,000 followers by September 2021. Activities are regularly updated on the page to attract followers. Engagement statistics from “like, comment and share” for posts of the page was as high as 30,000 hits.

- **Game Show and Workshop**: ThaiBev introduced activities in the form of game shows and workshops to increase participants’ understanding of “Serve Responsibly,” including group activities where ideas are shared and raised more awareness on the importance of responsibly serving. In 2020, there was only one training session with 40 participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ThaiBev aims for 150 alcoholic beverage providers to attend in 2021 and increases the ratio of Hotels-Restaurants-Catering (HoReCa) to On-Trade venues (such as pubs, bars, and public houses) from 80:20 to 60:40 given that On-Trade venues are on the rise. On-Trade venues are considered an important group in controlling alcoholic beverage consumption, so that it does not reach a harmful level to themselves and the society at large.

Moreover, ThaiBev works with partners like the Thai Alcohol Beverage Business Association (TABBA) and the Thai Foundation for Responsible Drinking (TFRD) in providing information for pamphlets, and promote and publicize various projects through their channels. They also changed their training to Level Up (Up Skill Up Scale) approach to increase participants’ knowledge and skills on serving and product details, which respond to consumers’ alcoholic beverage consumption in a “New Normal” way. In 2019, more than 100 establishments participated and 30 more joined in 2020.

# Commitments and Achievements

- ThaiBev has organized "Serve Responsibly" training sessions since 2016. Each year, there are 100 to 150 participants. To date, there have been 9 training sessions for more than 500 business operators and alcoholic beverage providers. Statistically, one provider will provide services to 20 consumers per day, or 6,000 consumers per year (calculated based on 25 working days per month). Thus, it is estimated that more than 2 million consumers have received care from business operators and alcoholic beverage providers throughout the project, resulting in safer alcoholic beverage consumption.

- All participants receive certificates after completing the training and satisfaction survey. Results from the 2020 survey are:
  - 100% of participants agreed that serve responsibly is part of their job and they vowed to practice it.
  - 85% of participants will share knowledge gained from the training with their colleagues and other staff.

- This project aligns with UN SDG Target 3.5 regarding harmful alcohol consumption according to each country’s standard of harmful level. After implementation of the project, alcoholic beverages providers who passed the training are able to apply their knowledge and stop serving intoxicated customers or those who are physically unfit. (With social responsibility, the quantity served decreased by 35%, stepping up 2% more than last year.)

# Achievements from the Serve Responsibly Project

Business operators and alcoholic beverage providers participated in the project as follows:

- In 2017 – 120 participants
- In 2018 – 140 participants
- In 2019 – 150 participants
- In 2020 – 40 participants (ThaiBev only organized one training due to COVID-19 pandemic.)

- The "Serve Responsibly" Facebook page has 3,200 followers.
- The number of followers increased by 2,000 people compared to 2019 (The page was launched on July 2019. From then to December 2019, there were 700 followers). Currently in September 2020, there were 3,200 followers.
- Post engagement from "Like, Comment and Share" is more than 30,000 hits for the post with the highest engagement.
- 95% of participants in the latest training (in Khon Kaen) were satisfied with the training.

# Insights

ThaiBev tries to reach out and assist on social issues in various forms. This project focuses on business operators and providers since they were considered to be in direct interaction with drinkers. When drinkers are intoxicated or show signs of unsteadiness, we do not want them to continue serving. Some places felt at first that it would decrease the sales. But we needed to educate them that we want providers to be aware and alert customers not to drink to an uncontrollable level. Importantly, this project is designed for service providers to educate them and help them take better care of their customers. Therefore, their customers will return to them as their loyal customers.

— Surapol Utitnu  
Vice President  
Office of External Affairs, Thai Beverage PLC



I think this project is very beneficial for business owners, producers, sellers, and also service providers to jointly be responsible for the society. Today I had a chance to be one of the speakers, sharing my experiences with participants. I want to thank ThaiBev, who is both a producer and seller of alcoholic beverages. They do not aim to only make profit. They care for the consumers and are aware of their responsibility towards society.

— Pol. Col. Khemarin Pitsamai  
Superintendent, Pattaya Police Station - Project Speaker



The training today helped us realize that service providers are contributors to a good society. This training was different than others. There were several fun activities mixed in with useful knowledge. I will share what I learned with my team. I would like to thank ThaiBev for offering me an opportunity to join such a rewarding project.

Beer Garden Manager, Ton Tann Green Market, Khon Kaen Province

# Moving Forward

ThaiBev set the following targets that once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided:

- ThaiBev aims to train 180 business operators and alcoholic beverage providers each year and share the knowledge with university students through the EISA and Beta Young networks. They plan to launch a video-making competition on “Serve Responsibly” with a goal to have 100 students from 20 universities participate.
- In 2021, the training format will be adjusted to the Level Up format (Up Skill Up Scale), together with a video-making competition on “Serve Responsibly” that allows students at universities to be creative and raise their awareness about social responsibility.
- In 2022 ThaiBev plans to expand the project to every region, with more than 1,500 participants, and to share knowledge about social responsibility with its employees, including those in PG, sales and marketing, etc.

# Sustainable Sourcing

To ensure that all products are sourced using standardized and environmentally and socially responsible procurement processes throughout the value chain, ThaiBev has placed a strong value on raw material sourcing policies and standards, adopting high-quality service with regards to delivery, supplier assessment processes, and supplier engagement activities. ThaiBev has developed strategies and systems to manage its supply chain and business continuity as well as to avoid negative economic, social, and environmental impacts, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# TSCN Business Partner Conference 2020 and ThaiBev Business Partner Award

In 2020, ThaiBev and its partners from various networks, together with TSCN, organized the Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) 2020 under the concept of “Sufficiency for Sustainability” by applying His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s (Rama IX) Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and the first Royal Command of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua (Rama X): “I shall continue, preserve, and build upon the royal legacy and shall reign with righteousness for the benefit of the people forever.” TSX used this as guidance, in order for stakeholders to recognize the significance of sustainable development.

Additionally, ThaiBev worked with TSCN to organize the TSCN Business Partner Conference 2020, as part of TSX, to join a network of stakeholders and featuring collaboration between Thailand’s leading organizations. The conference was honored by the presence of executives from Thailand’s leading organizations on sustainable development, including Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited, and Thai Union Group Public Company Limited, who have shared their visions and success factors as global leaders in sustainability. Furthermore, experts on sustainability from different industries also shared their experience and knowledge under the concept of “Creating and Sharing the Values of Growth for a Sustainable Future” in order to encourage business sector to take actions and align their goals with the UN SDGs. TSCN platform, an online business community, was also launched to allow business partners.

# CROSS – Procurement Transformation

In 2017, ThaiBev initiated the CROSS project to increase supply chain visibility and raise the standard of procurement by fostering stakeholder collaboration, process re-engineering, and online connectivity. The principles of the CROSS project include:

| C | R | O | S | S |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COLLABORATE | RE-ENGINEER | ONLINE | SIMPLIFY | SYNERGIZE |
| Foster collaboration between ThaiBev and its suppliers | Re-engineer procurement processes effectively | Work on online solutions for speed and transparency | Develop a user-friendly solution and agile manner of work | Synergize people and technology for maximum benefits |

The CROSS project is a digital procurement system that improves sourcing processes for greater efficiency, while transparently improving data visibility and traceability. The system helps reduce operating costs by linking suppliers and buyers online. ThaiBev has implemented CROSS Procurement solution and connected it with the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) system. The SLCM system acts as the central interface to monitor and communicate with ThaiBev’s suppliers. Here suppliers can register to become ThaiBev’s suppliers, undertake their sustainability risk assessments, confirm purchase orders, and exchange documents online. The CROSS Procurement solution will also play a role in fulfilling the procurement processes. The solution instantly records the purchase of products and services that take place throughout ThaiBev’s operations. This ensures that procurement is fair, transparent, and traceable. The solution consists of 4 features:

1. **CROSS Source**
   - For the selection of potential suppliers by taking into account environmental, social, and governance factors as well as the supplier’s capability. CROSS Source connects with the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) system and covers the entire supplier qualification process from Supplier Code of Practice compliance, to supplier registration, supplier screening, supplier selection, and bidding.

2. **CROSS Contract**
   - For contract creation and agreement with suppliers through a traceable and transparent system. It also covers contract compliance, managing the purchase of products in line with contractual terms.

3. **CROSS Buy**
   - For purchase order issuance to and confirmation with the determined suppliers and for purchasing products through eCatalogs (online product catalogs).

4. **CROSS SRM (Supplier Risk Management)**
   - For suppliers’ sustainability risk assessments covering environmental, social, and governance factors, and other areas such as supplier credibility, financial liquidity, operational risk, and negative media coverage that may affect suppliers’ reputations. The risk input is derived from third-party databases specializing in corporate risk assessments, such as the World Economic Forum, Dunn & Bradstreet, GDACS, and Semantic Visions.

ThaiBev continues to apply CROSS Procurement in its sourcing processes to improve data visibility and analytic capability as well as support decision making and sourcing strategizing, in turn enabling effective and real-time risk management.

# Commitments and Achievements

## Collaboration for Sustainable Supply Chain

- ThaiBev selects quality raw materials for alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, and food production through socially and environmentally responsible procurement processes in line with international standards such as BonSucro, ProTerra, SEDEX, RSPO, etc. Examples of ThaiBev’s key agricultural raw materials include malt, sugar, broken rice, palm oil, and tea leaves.
- ThaiBev works with suppliers to provide knowledge and resources to farmers to help mitigate impacts from climate change and natural disasters that affect the quantity and price of agricultural raw materials as well as local farmers’ income and wellbeing.
- ThaiBev has formalized processes to identify its critical suppliers annually in order to develop the supplier relationship management strategies, together with the prioritization of resources used and appropriate supplier risk management. This enables ThaiBev to identify and mitigate any potential risks in the procurement processes throughout the supply chain.

## Business Resilience and Risk Management

- ThaiBev considers sustainability factors in all aspects of its procurement process and requires suppliers to comply with the Supplier Code of Practice and undergo strict supplier screening and quality assurance processes. ThaiBev also makes sustainability one of the criteria in supplier qualification, bidding, and supplier performance evaluation.

## Capacity Development for Local Suppliers

- In 2020, 95% of ThaiBev’s procurement came from local suppliers following its policy to encourage sourcing from nearby business operations considering both sustainability and economic aspects. It aims to reduce environmental impacts by optimizing transportation distances, fuel consumption, and air pollution. This also helps boost income distribution and job creation among SME suppliers and in the surrounding communities.
- ThaiBev builds local suppliers’ capacity through the Business Partner Award, provision of knowledge related to sustainability, and engagement in various sustainability projects. This allows ThaiBev to have more sourcing alternatives and mitigate risk from limited raw materials. This includes risks from the importation of raw materials and services, including delays in transportation and the interruption of business operations.

# Good Corporate Governance

ThaiBev is determined to abide by the principles of good corporate governance in line with ThaiBev’s Code of Business Conduct. Appropriate risk management plans are established in accordance with ThaiBev’s sustainable development approach, and information is disclosed transparently and adequately to give confidence to shareholders, investors, employees, customers, and stakeholders. ThaiBev is also determined to support and develop customers’ business potentials for stronger and more sustainable growth to create long-term shareholder value while considering stakeholders inside and outside the organization.

The Board of Directors takes a leadership role to ensure ThaiBev’s leading business position by determining business direction, strategy, operational objectives, and long-term success for ThaiBev Group. This allows ThaiBev to conduct its business according to its business plans, shareholders’ resolutions, laws and regulations, and company’s goals and articles of association. The Board of Directors also oversees that the companies in ThaiBev Group and their subsidiaries comply with the rules and regulations of the Singapore Exchange and other relevant stock exchanges. (The Company’s organizational structure and Corporate Governance Report are in the Annual Report 2020 and on the website www.thaibev.com)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore Exchange Limited allowed registered companies to hold electronic meetings by following certain protocol. The number of attendees and organizers should include not more than 6 people in one venue. Questions must be submitted to attendees 72 hours prior to the meeting, and attendees must comply with physical distancing measures. This allows registered companies to hold the meetings on time. On 19 June 2020, ThaiBev organized its Annual Information Meeting between the company and stockholders in Singapore online. Attendees could submit questions regarding the business and its operations in advance for board members and executives to clarify. ThaiBev also disclosed information through SGXNET on the same day. The board and sub-committee meetings of ThaiBev and subsidiary companies were held as e-meetings to allow board members and executives who are in Thailand and abroad to join and provide opinions and suggestions per specific rules and regulations.

Furthermore, ThaiBev announced a Whistleblowing Policy as a way to emphasize the importance of receiving and responding to concerns about suspected wrongdoings in the company. Directors, executives, and employees can raise these concerns. In 2020, no significant incidents of conflict were found and no significant cases of grievances related to ethics were investigated or found to be valid.

# Code of Business Conduct

ThaiBev established its Code of Business Conduct to pursue integrity, legal compliance, morality, and ethics. The executives, managers, and employees must adhere to the Code of Business Conduct for ThaiBev to achieve the company's objective of upholding ethical conduct and standards.

ThaiBev has a duty to maintain transparency in its operations and to protect the interests of its shareholders by considering present and future market conditions and risk factors, and treats employees, customers, and business partners ethically. ThaiBev is committed to ensuring that its personnel understand, accept, and follow the company’s Code of Business Conduct. This will result in:

- The company’s ability to uphold its responsibility to society and stakeholders
- Employees’ work efficiency
- Fairness within the organization
- Employee’s dignity and integrity
- The company being socially accepted
- Employees’ well-being

# Anti-Corruption

Corruption is a criminal offense that affects free competition and breaches the company’s Code of Business Conduct. It results in damage to the company’s reputation, loss of stakeholders’ confidence, and impacts the company’s profits.

ThaiBev operates its business transparently, morally, and adheres to the principles of fairness and in compliance with the Code of Business Conduct while striving to provide maximum values for stakeholders in Thailand and abroad. ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy establishes practices to protect against corruption and serve as a guideline for business to create a stable and sustainable future.

In the case of changes to the business, regulations, standards, and the law, the President and CEO is responsible for monitoring and implementing an efficient anti-corruption system, reporting to the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and reviewing and revising policies to ensure they are up-to-date and responsive to any changes. The company has specified the roles and duties of all parties as follows:

- Senior-level executives are responsible for ensuring policy compliance and collaborate with board members, managers, and employees in compliance monitoring.
- Board members and employees have the duty to maintain the highest standards when doing business.
- Employees must not neglect evidence of corruption.
- Employees must cooperate in investigating the facts.

Failure to act in accordance with ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy is a severe disciplinary offense, violates ThaiBev’s employment contract, and is a criminal offense. Violating the anti-corruption policy can cause severe damage to the company’s reputation. If corruption is discovered, it should be reported to the employee’s line manager. Any person found to violate the policy will be disciplined in accordance to ThaiBev’s rules and prosecuted under the law.

# Handling Complaints

All employees are obligated to file a complaint when they discover an act that may be considered wrongdoing. Employees who file a fair and truthful complaint shall not face any repercussions or harms from the complaint. The process of filing complaints is as follows:

- Board member should file the complaint with the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
- If an employee has a complaint, the employee should file the complaint in writing through the recommended channels, giving their name and contact details and file it with a responsible company official.
- Every employee can report suspicious information directly to the President and CEO via email at whistleblowing@thaibev.com or file the complaint to employee’s line manager.
- ThaiBev is ready to protect any employee who files a complaint with a factual basis; confidentiality will be maintained while taking strict action against wrongdoing.

- If it is found afterwards that the complaint was false, corrupt, malicious, careless, or for personal benefit, this will be considered a disciplinary offense as stated in the ThaiBev Employee Handbook. Channels for filing complaints are publicized through the company’s internal media.

# Breaches of Regulations and the Law

ThaiBev requires that all employees comply with its rules and regulations, and the laws of countries that ThaiBev operates in. Any breach of applicable regulations in terms of ethics, organizational standards of excellence, or violations of human rights on the business premises must be stopped immediately and appropriate measures taken. In 2020, some minor cases were reported. Breaches were categorized by the monetary value of the action. Major cases involve a monetary value of 300,000 baht or more; minor cases involve less than 300,000 baht. To prevent breaches of the regulations, ThaiBev has implemented the following procedures to prevent corruption:

- Conduct orientation for new employees and executives.
- Provide online training courses for employees.
- Communicate business ethics for employees.
- Communicate and require all employees to follow the Code of Business Conduct.
- Take decisive action when fraud is discovered as it may involve legal action.

Remark: For more information on major and minor cases please visit www.sustainability.thaibev.com

* **Emergency situation was declared nationwide. Section 9 of Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situation B.E. 2548 and governors’ declaration and commands based on Communicable Disease Act B.E. 2558** regulated the following measures:
  - Closure of COVID-19 at risk public venues such as entertainment venues, service providing venues, live-entertainment venues, massage parlors and any venues that perform similar services.
  - Prohibition of dine-in customers at restaurants.
  - Closure of shopping malls with restricted opening for essential products.
  - Closure of shops or establishments that hold Type 1 and 2 Alcohol License. ThaiBev was directly impacted given that ThaiBev holds Type 1 Alcohol License.
  - Designated hours in which people are prohibited from leaving their residences, except in necessary and exceptional cases.
  - Prohibition of cross-province transportation at certain hours.

Given the above government orders, ThaiBev had to adjust its production, sales, and distribution plans in accordance to product shelf life and financial liquidity while being able to meet customers’ and consumers’ needs and ensuring business continuity. The plan also includes ensuring employee safety in work environment as some employees had to work in the offices while others worked from home following the government order. To ensure employee well-being, ThaiBev distributed alcohol gel, masks, and other essential items to employees.

# Adapting to Regulatory Changes

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of compliance with rules and regulations to reduce the risk of being fined or having its licenses revoked, which would impact its business. In 2020, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Thai government implemented measures to protect and contain the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand. Some of the government’s regulations affected ThaiBev and led the company to adjust its business practices. Additionally, the company has law firm who constantly monitors changes in laws and regulations in Thailand. ThaiBev has various channels to monitor changes in laws and regulations in Thailand, for instance, being a member of The Thai Chamber of Commerce, The Board of Trade of Thailand and The Federation of Thai Industries. Moreover, ThaiBev regularly reviews government websites such as those of The Secretariat of the Prime Minister, The Secretariat of the Cabinet, The Secretariat of the House of Representative, The Royal Gazette, The Office of the Council of State, etc. Consequently, in 2020, ThaiBev adjusted its policies as follows:

* **Emergency Decree on Electronic Meetings B.E. 2563**
  In the past, an electronic meeting must follow Announcement No. 74/2557 of the National Council of Peace and Order on electronic meetings, which was signed on June 27, 2014. It specified that one third of attendees must be in the same venue, and all attendees must be in Thailand during the meeting, which is difficult in practice and does not follow physical distancing measure to control and reduce COVID-19 infections per guideline of the World Health Organization. Thus, ThaiBev was not able to hold the electronic meeting as required by law. The Emergency Decree on Electronic Meetings B.E. 2563, which became effective on 19 April 2020, changed electronic meeting criteria by removing the requirements for all attendees to be at the same venue in Thailand. Hence, ThaiBev was able to organize Board of Directors meetings through electronic channel where some of the board members attended the electronic meeting from oversea. ThaiBev’s electronic meeting is conducted with secured online technology and in accordance with the applicable laws.

# ThaiBev and Public Policy

ThaiBev has an efficient management system that focuses on integrity and transparency, with a framework of fairness and accountability. ThaiBev coordinates with and supports various organizations in both public and private sectors. In the past years, ThaiBev has collaborated with numerous agencies with the following objectives:

ThaiBev supports The Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand because these 2 organizations are juristic persons who represent the private sector in coordination of policies and operations with the public sector. They also give advice and suggestions to the government and are core coordinators who facilitate cooperation to promote information sharing and joint business development, trade, and investment, together with the protection of rights and justices that the members are entitled to, both nationally and internationally. Additionally, they promote and support studies, research, training, and dissemination of knowledge and technology on industry and trade.

# Examples of support for various organizations

- **The Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand**  
  In order to strengthen competitive capacity, ThaiBev works with the Thai Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand, and a network of business owners to suggest solutions regarding the development and strengthening of business owners’ capacity on major public policies such as collaborating to identify the model of commerce and investment under the Thai-Vietnam Business Council, ensuring local public confidence during COVID-19, helping the public and students gain income, supporting communication, by publishing the Business Practice Guideline on Safety for business entities and the public to follow the “New Normal” way of life. These are just some of the ways that ThaiBev mobilizes for the benefit for the industry.

- **The Thai Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE), through the Federation of Thai Industries.**  
  ThaiBev supports the promotion of the 3Rs principles (reduce, reuse, and recycle), including packaging practices that focus on sustainable environmental protection. In order to do so, ThaiBev supports promotion of knowledge and understanding of reused packaging and recyclable materials through packaging life cycle. The company has organized a campaign to raise awareness of waste separation in all sectors. ThaiBev has supported the Federation of Thai Industries in environmental research and development on sustainability, together with advocacy for the 3Rs principles in trainings, seminars, and knowledge sharing between suppliers in the beverage industry. This is a private-sector collaboration to manage post-consumption packaging with a focus on reducing environmental impacts and creating better management of packaging waste in Thailand.

# Corporate Governance and Business Ethics

## The Federation of Thai Industries
ThaiBev pays a membership fee and supports the Federation’s annual operations and activities. ThaiBev provides research funds to the Federation to support packaging management and campaigns to separate used packaging and reduce environmental impact. ThaiBev also participated in brainstorming sessions with the Ministry of Industry to address product shortages during COVID-19, where ThaiBev affirmed that there were no shortages of its products, and that they were sufficiently available for public consumption.

## Thai-UK Business Leadership Council (TUBLC)
ThaiBev, as chairman of Thai-UK Business Leadership Council (TUBLC), is determined to be part of growth between the two nations by supporting commerce and investment opportunities, exploring business opportunities for entrepreneurs in Thailand and the U.K., and driving private sector suggestions to the government to strengthen competitive capacity in both countries. Mobilization works are divided into two taskforces, which are:
1. Trade and Investment Promotion Taskforce
2. Trade Policy Review Taskforce, to create good understanding on international trade regulations and to drive proposals on beneficial trade in both countries.

In the past, there were ongoing meetings with public, private, academic, and civil sectors to prepare for upcoming challenges such as Brexit, which affects trade and investment rules and regulations. This includes exported items from Thailand to the U.K.

## Thai-Vietnam Business Council
ThaiBev joined the board and participates in activities that are key to fostering relationships in various aspects, like trade and investment, and encourages solutions to challenges in business operations between the two countries. In the past, ThaiBev worked with the Thai-Vietnam Business Council, C asean, and SCG Group to host “Thailand-Vietnam on Mutual Growth and Development” at C asean to develop the relationship, expand the business network, and exchange opinions between Thai and Vietnamese entrepreneurs in order to develop Thai entrepreneurs’ capacity to trade and invest in Vietnam.

## Thailand Management Association (TMA)
ThaiBev recognizes the importance of mobilizing non-profit organizations to create talented workers as an asset for the country. This also elevates Thailand’s competitive capacity and that of its businesses, and prepares businesspersons for a sustainable future with ThaiBev executives serving as the Advisory Committee of the TMA Center for Competitiveness and the Steering Committee of TMA Center for Competitiveness. ThaiBev also provides budget for various TMA activities, including the Thailand Competitiveness Conference, which allows businesspersons to propose ideas that will facilitate organizations’ ability to compete and respond to consumers. The company also organized a Sustainability Forum, which focused on business practices in line with the UN SDGs, and a Digital Management Forum, at which ThaiBev executives shared visions for digital management and provided information to the organizations.

## UN Global Compact and Global Compact Network Thailand
In 2019, ThaiBev became a member of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) joining the UNGC’s framework on sustainable development to expand collaboration across all sectors, including industrial, foundations, non-profit, and all other organization that have sustainability as a goal. This involved the industries, foundations, non-profit organizations, and other organizations that have sustainability goals. This includes strategy and operations that align with UNGC’s 10 principles covering 4 aspects, namely anti-corruption, environmental protection, labor, and human rights. ThaiBev participated in seminars and workshops that were organized by the Global Compact Network of Thailand (GCNT) in order to mobilize the organization and its network of members, who together possess a clear vision about sustainable development in relation to Human Rights Principles and the 17 UN SDGs.

## Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN)
ThaiBev worked with seven other private organizations to establish the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) to collaborate and increase investments among each other. TSCN’s operations have 3 objectives: 
1. To protect investment values, such as business continuity management, business laws, finance and social responsibility.
2. To add value to the investments, which includes collaboration to promote efficiency of existing works like cross-selling, cross-training, joint ventures, joint resources utilization.
3. To co-create innovation and extend investments in projects that have never been invested in before, such as online platform co-creation, joint funds for startups, cross-training on employee skills, and employing program developers for local projects.


In the future, TSCN plans to expand collaboration in other countries in ASEAN or ASEAN +3 (Japan, China, and South Korea). Fundamentally, TSCN is divided into 5 working groups to increase management efficiency. These 5 groups are logistics and supply chain, health, sustainability and circular economy, education, and Pride of ASEAN.

# Independent Assurance Statement

## Relating to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for the fiscal year 2020 (1st October 2019 – 30th September 2020)

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.

### Terms of engagement

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (LR) was commissioned by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev), to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report (“the report”) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LR’s verification procedure. LR’s verification procedure is based on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000¹ and uses the following principles of - inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and reliability of performance data.

Our assurance engagement covered ThaiBev’s operations and activities in Thailand, Myanmar, and United Kingdom specifically the following requirements:

- Confirming that the report is in accordance with GRI Standards (2016) and core option
- Evaluating the reliability of data and information for only the selected environmental and social indicators listed below:
  - **Economic**: GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed
  - **Environment**: GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization, GRI 302-3 Energy intensity, GRI 303-3 (2018 edition) Water withdrawal, GRI 303-4 (2018 edition) Water discharge, GRI 303-5 (2018 edition) Water consumption, GRI 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, GRI 305-4 GHG emissions intensity, GRI 306-2 Waste by type and disposal method
  - **Social**: GRI 403-1 (2018 edition) Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system, GRI 403-9 (2018 edition) Work-related injuries, GRI 403-10 (2018 edition) Work-related ill health, GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee, GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews, GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the report.

LR’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LR disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived. Ultimately, the report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

### LR’s Opinion

Based on LR’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not, in all material respects:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier.

**Note**: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

### LR’s approach

LR’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Assessing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement to confirm that issues raised by stakeholders were captured correctly.
  - We did this by interviewing ThaiBev’s Management who engaged directly with stakeholder groups as well as reviewing documents and associated records.
- Auditing ThaiBev’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or misstatements in the data. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal verification. We also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling the data and drafting the report.

¹ GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty.

### Note:
1. LR did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations.
2. LR did not visit the plants in the United Kingdom and Myanmar. Data for these locations were reviewed remotely.

## Observations

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:

- **Inclusivity:**
  - We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from ThaiBev’s engagement process.

- **Materiality:**
  - ThaiBev has processes for identifying and determining material issues; the evaluation process considers factors such as stakeholder concerns, business risks and legal compliance and we are not aware of any major material issue having been excluded.

- **Responsiveness:**
  - ThaiBev and its subsidiaries have processes for responding to various stakeholder groups. We believe that ThaiBev should address further on circular economy business model through its stakeholder groups, typically with supply chains and customers.

- **Reliability:**
  - Data management systems are established and centralized for the data and information collection and calculation associated with the selected GRI indicators. However, we believe that ThaiBev should work further on the accuracy of GHG emissions from biogas flow meters as it will play an important role in ThaiBev carbon reduction roadmap.

## LR’s standards, competence and independence

LR ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.

This verification is the only work undertaken by LR for ThaiBev and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
