### Works for His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej and other royal family members and relationship with the court

Since 1990 Mr. Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi and his alcoholic beverages companies were part of The Royal Chitralada Projects’ Experimental Fuel Production Project with activities as followed.

### Experimental Fuel Production Project

In 1990 Surathip Co., Ltd. had improved alcohol refinery to produce alcohol with purity of 95%, together with production from molasses of 5 liters per hour. Mr. Charoen also was invited to be adviser of this project, which he also donated 200,000 baht.

In 1994, Surathip Co., Ltd. also worked with The Royal Chitralada Projects to increase the production of alcohol at the proportion that can be mixed with benzene at the ratio of 1:4. The result is 25% alcohol fuel, which is called “gasohol”.

Gasohol produced by the project was used to run every car in The Royal Chitralada Projects. In 1995, ThaiBev also supported the building of refinery and fermenter to celebrate the special occasion of His Majesty’s 50th Anniversary of his Accession to the Throne. Since then technicians from Surathip Co., Ltd. had worked on the maintenance of the refinery and fermenter until now.

In 2001, Sangsom Co., Ltd. had worked to improve the visibility in production room.

In 2005, ThaiBev re-painted the building, improved electric system and upgraded production equipment.

In 2006, ThaiBev had refurbished new roof for the refinery, meeting room and molasses retention pond.

In 2008, ThaiBev had upgraded mechanic system and improved fermenter, alcohol refinery and the building, which had been in operation since 1995.

In 2009, ThaiBev also donated 95% alcohol to The Royal Chitralada Projects for internal use and also refurbished alcohol refinery and its signage. In addition to The Royal Chitralada Projects, ThaiBev also works with numerous royal initiated projects such as The Chaipattana Foundation, Rajaprajanugroh Foundation under the Royal Patronage, Royal Project Foundation, Pradabos Foundation, Foundation for the Promotion of Supplementary Occupations and Related Techniques (Support) of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, Mae Fah Luang Foundation Under Royal Patronage, Princess Mother’s Medical Volunteer Foundation, Prostheses Foundation of Her Royal Highness the Princess Mother and SaiJaiThai Foundation under the Royal Patronage.

# ThaiBev's Sustainable Development Efforts

I am pleased to report that ThaiBev’s sustainable development effort is recognized by Dow Jones Sustainable Index (DJSI) in awarding Thai Beverage Public Company Limited as an index component of the Beverage industry in Emerging Market category in 2016. Our management, staff and stakeholders are most honored and encouraged by this sustainability recognition. And we are even more committed now to strive harder in creating and sharing the value of growth for a sustainable world, of which the goal is also in line with United Nation’s sustainable development initiative.

Our inspirations for this journey are drawn from our commitment to business excellence, our strong values applied with heart, our pride of being Asian and our desire to give back. Most of all, our sustainability journey is inspired by the example of our late king, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.

His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in his reign of 70 years, had devoted his life to help and develop better lives for his people, especially the poor in the rural areas. He worked tirelessly to fulfill the promise he made on his coronation in 1950: "I shall reign with righteousness for the benefits and happiness of the Siamese people." Over seven decades, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej fulfilled this promise by creating more than 4,400 sustainable development projects across Thailand. The lessons he learned and the principles he applied have been distilled into a compelling sustainability strategy known as the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP).

At ThaiBev, we have adopted SEP into our working principles to achieve sustainability, good governance and regional cooperation. We have also placed a special emphasis on supporting the preservation of culture. It is remarkable how much His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s SEP has in common with the United Nations’ more recently launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By committing ourselves to honor His Majesty’s lifelong work, we believe we will also help the world achieve these SDGs.

One example of ThaiBev’s leading role in pursuing sustainability is our support and participation in the Thai government’s "Pracharath Policy", which enables collaborations between the government, private sector, academic, civil society and people sectors. We are proud to be part of this project, with special focus on assisting the rural economy through area-based social enterprise initiatives. In particular, ThaiBev is focused on helping rural communities improve their agricultural products, enhance their agriproduct processing capabilities and strengthen their community-based tourism. We helped the local communities realize their resources and share our experience in helping them develop initiatives to raise their income and improve their competitiveness and capabilities, thereby making the communities become more self-sufficient and independent.

Besides our social and community development projects, ThaiBev also conducts and supports numerous activities that advance arts and culture, health, education and sports. All of these endeavors are in line with the principles of SEP and many of the SDGs as well.

In the environmental area, ThaiBev has increasingly integrated, adopted and applied our business to the so-called "circular economy", meaning we are managing our resources with greater productivity through effective water management, by preventing pollution, and recycling and reusing waste materials. ThaiBev is also continually upgrading our technology to improve Supply Chain Management and investment in packaging innovation.

As ThaiBev strives to be the "Stable and Sustainable ASEAN Leader in Total Beverages Business" by 2020, we are fully committed to aligning the sustainable development platform of our own Vision 2020 with the principles of SEP, the UN’s SDGs, SGX’s practice note and GRI guidelines, as well as global sustainability trends and innovations to create a powerful, multi-pronged platform that enables both growth and balanced sustainable development. We see this as an effective way to act as both a business and a social enterprise, to succeed together with our local communities, to earn the trust of stakeholders, and to create and share even greater opportunities to make a sustainable world, and to be a truly responsible and sustainable total beverage company.

Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi

# ThaiBev’s Sustainability Approach

## Sustainability Strategy

ThaiBev’s sustainability approach is inspired by and based on the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand and on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ThaiBev believes that such an approach is essential in guiding it towards growth in knowledge and experience, and enabling ThaiBev to share the value of this growth with its stakeholders and society as a whole. SEP, as a decision-making framework, emphasizes three guiding principles: Moderation, Reasonableness, and Prudence. According to His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, if these principles are applied with Knowledge and Virtue, they will help lead one’s business to sustainability and success.

### Principles of SEP

- **MODERATION**
  - Within means and capacities
  - Avoiding extremes
  - Ensuring financial discipline

- **REASONABLENESS**
  - Assessing causes and effects of actions on all stakeholders
  - Creating real value for stakeholders

- **PRUDENCE**
  - Risk management
  - Preparing for future impacts or change

ThaiBev employees should make sure that their decision-making and actions are in line with the three principles of SEP.

### Key Values

- **KNOWLEDGE**
  - Insight
  - Right understanding
  - Appreciation of wisdom and experiences

- **VIRTUE**
  - Honesty
  - Altruism
  - Perseverance
  - Mindfulness
  - Humility

ThaiBev believes in the benefits of building sustainable growth based on the three guiding principles with the support of SEP’s two key values, Knowledge and Virtue.

As a whole, the application of SEP will lead to balanced progress across the four dimensions of life: Economic, Social, Environmental, and Cultural. Through its sustainability strategy, ThaiBev is committed to using SEP in its own decision-making across all aspects of its business operations, and to achieving positive outcomes in those four dimensions of life. As ThaiBev pursues its journey and gains experience along the way, ThaiBev believes it can create limitless opportunities for the company and the world.

### Four Dimensions of Life

- **ECONOMIC**
  - Creating Business Value

- **ENVIRONMENTAL**
  - Managing Impacts

- **SOCIAL**
  - Caring and Sharing

- **CULTURAL**
  - Preserving National Culture

# Sustainability Report  
Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

In addition to SEP, ThaiBev has fully embraced the aspirational 17 SDGs of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs are helping ThaiBev set targets to improve the efficiency of its operations in many areas. ThaiBev sees SEP and the SDGs as consistent with each other, providing both a local and international basis for the company to approach sustainable development. Both SEP and the SDGs highlight the need to use knowledge, experience, and creativity in the name of creating shared prosperity and balanced progress. Both recognize the importance of protecting the environment and treating human resources with sensitivity and compassion. Both believe in the positive consequences of economic growth, but only if such growth is reasonable and does not court excessive risk.

SEP and the SDGs are also consistent with ThaiBev’s Vision 2020 to be the “Stable and Sustainable ASEAN leader” in the beverage industry. ThaiBev focuses on building relationships and participation from stakeholders in order for them to sustainably grow as ThaiBev’s business grows.

ThaiBev believes that by basing its sustainability strategy on SEP and the 17 SDGs the company, its entire value chain, the environment, society, and the countries in which it operates will benefit and achieve more balanced progress.

# Materiality Assessment Process

1. **Issue Identification**
2. **Issue Prioritization**
3. **Establishment of Reporting Boundaries**
4. **Verification and Continuous Development**

## Step 1: Issue Identification

**Implications to Business:** ThaiBev selected the sustainability issues that are consistent with its business operations, starting from global megatrends and focusing on topics that are relevant to ThaiBev in the following categories:

- Consistency between the megatrends and ThaiBev’s future strategies and missions
- Consistency between the megatrends and ThaiBev’s material issues of 2014 and 2015
- Consistency between the megatrends and international standards such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI)
- Consistency between the megatrends and industry trends in the global food and beverage industry, as well as the National Social and Economic Development Plan No. 12, and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals

ThaiBev selected the issues with relevant experts and external sustainability experts in order to correctly identify the issues that are most relevant to ThaiBev’s strategy. As a result, 17 topics were deemed to be most important to ThaiBev in the present and future.

### Implications to Stakeholders

In 2016, ThaiBev undertook a stakeholder survey of all eight groups related to the 17 sustainability issues. The survey results, which covered economic, social, and environmental dimensions, were used to prioritize these issues, and were also considered in comparison with ThaiBev’s 2014 and 2015 material issues. Additionally, the Company conducted interviews with international sustainability experts in order to receive comments, observations, and suggestions, which were utilized in the development of the most appropriate sustainability management frameworks.

### Expert Insights

- **Ruth Mathews**
  - Executive Director, Water Footprint Network
  - *"Water is a sustainability issue of global importance. Food and beverages manufacturing companies must demonstrate a determination to tackle this issue from the very beginning of their supply chain through to their customer. Additionally, ThaiBev, as an industry leader, can be a part of the global sustainable development effort by integrating the principles of environmental, social, and economic sustainability into the company’s strategies and by cooperating with its own and other sectors to generate positive effects on society and the environment."*

- **Paul Begley**
  - Programme Director, Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership
  - *"Businesses such as ThaiBev have a critical role in delivering sustainability. Through the Sustainable Development Goals, governments around the world have agreed a strategy for a fair, prosperous, and sustainable society. By proactively aligning the strategy to these Goals, companies can generate new commercial value and mitigate risk while contributing to a vibrant and zero carbon society."*

# Step 2: Issue Prioritization

The chosen 17 sustainability issues were prioritized using two categories: sustainability issues affecting the stakeholders and sustainability issues affecting the business in 5 to 10 years, which includes:

1. Impact to Business (costs and income)
2. Impact to Reputation

The assessment of the sustainability issues is consistent with ThaiBev’s risk management criteria.

## ThaiBev’s Risk Management Criteria

| Consequence / Impact | Probability/Likelihood | | | | | Action required by risk exposure |
|----------------------|------------------------|---|---|---|---|---------------------------------|
|                      | 1 Rare                 | 2 Unlikely | 3 Possible | 4 Likely | 5 Almost Certain | Risk Exposure | Action required |
| 5 Catastrophic       | H 10                   | H 15       | H 20       | E 25     | E 25             | Extremely High (E) | Immediate Action Required |
| 4 Major              | M 8                    | M 12       | H 16       | E 20     |                  | High (H) | Senior Management Attention Needed |
| 3 Moderate           | M 6                    | M 9        | H 12       | H 15     |                  | Moderate (M) | Management Responsibility Must Be Specified (Senior Vice President, Vice President) |
| 2 Minor              | L 4                    | L 6        | M 8        | M 10     |                  | Low (L) | Manage by Routine Procedures |
| 1 Insignificant      | L 1                    | L 2        | L 3        | M 4      | M 5              |            |                                 |

The Sustainable Development Working Team and experts from relevant agencies held a workshop with the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee to seek endorsement on the 17 material issues of ThaiBev and its subsidiaries, which were selected from the materiality assessment process.

# Innovation

**Innovation and the application of appropriate technology to create solutions and self-sufficiency is at the heart of SEP and also ThaiBev’s own approach toward sustainability.**

Consumer behavior and demands are changing rapidly owing to growing populations, rising incomes, and new lifestyle trends. All of these factors pose significant challenges to the food and beverages industry, creating demand for new products and also innovations in how the products are produced. At the same time, growing concern for social and environmental issues also drives the industry to improve both its products and processes.

Product and process innovation is thus central to business success in the food and beverages industry in today’s ever-changing environment. ThaiBev emphasizes its product innovation to increase its product range, while putting strong emphasis on process innovation not only to improve its efficiency and productivity but also to respond to the changing trends that could pose risks to its business. Additionally, ThaiBev continuously seeks to encourage innovation within its organization as a means to address global social and environmental challenges and achieve long-term goals, in line with Goal 9 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

| Process Innovation | Product Innovation |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Reach** - building the company’s status as leader throughout all processes | **Growth** - strengthening the company’s position in the market |
| **Professionalism** - benefiting from synergies of all parts | **Diversity** - increasing non-alcoholic beverages revenue |
| | **Brands** - expanding businesses |

The idea of innovation in both products and production process is in line with ThaiBev’s Vision 2020, which aims to achieve long-term goals.

# Process Innovation

ThaiBev strives to implement best practice processes and state-of-the-art technology to optimize operations and add value to the organization. Across the value chain, ThaiBev progressively identifies improvements through process innovation. For instance, this includes the development of software for its product distribution system which enables it to monitor the status of logistics operations and increase the efficiency of its communication channels. Additionally, at its operational sites, ThaiBev emphasizes operational efficiency through mechanization, which is the change in manufacturing processes where machines replace people to improve speed and accuracy, reduce manual labor, and improve the workforce’s quality of life. The machines used must be of high production capacity and maintained in their best condition to suit current needs.

## Automated Bottle Sorting Tool

ThaiBev has developed an automated bottle sorting tool to identify incorrectly returned drinking water and soda bottles and to prevent these bottles entering the bottling process. This tool allows it to remove incorrect bottles from the bottling line with a 100% success rate. Therefore, losses of water, soda, additional packaging, and labor costs have been significantly reduced.

# Water Bottling Line Improvement

For the 1500 ml. water bottling line, ThaiBev increased the filling valve's speed so that water bottles are filled faster. The Company also improved the fitting of parts to extend the lifespan of the filling valve while increasing the speed of filling. This innovation is currently under review for patent approval by the Department of Intellectual Property, Ministry of Commerce. Additionally, ThaiBev also increased the efficiency of the bottle rinsing process by resolving losses due to leakages at the rinsing set and modifying the rinser, resulting in a saving of 102,312 liters of water annually.

# Golden Award Under the Genba Kaizen

In addition, ThaiBev won the "Golden Award" under the "Genba Kaizen" sub-heading in the "Thailand Kaizen Award". This award shows how well ThaiBev has adopted the Kaizen approach, which focuses on changing or improving processes to manage its work more efficiently and effectively in a steady manner. ThaiBev’s staff were able to adapt and improve their workflow and successfully extend this to other automated and semi-automated mechanical aids.

# Product Innovation

The food and beverage market is intensely competitive. With consumers offered numerous choices of foods and drinks to purchase, product innovation is crucial to ThaiBev’s business, as ThaiBev aims to diversify and grow its market position. New products mean new consumers. Its stance on product innovation is that ThaiBev wants to create a more exciting and interesting consumption culture and experiences. By continuously listening to consumer feedback and conducting market research, its product development team leverages advanced technology and uses it for products that meet consumers’ needs.

## Oishi Kyoho

Oishi, leader in the ready-to-drink tea market, has developed innovative products based on a Japanese identity that is fun and oriented towards the younger generation. The launch was a new product: Oishi Green Tea with Kyoho Grapes Flavoring and Nata de Coco, making it the first green tea product in Thailand with Nata de Coco. After the launch, Oishi Kyoho was extremely successful among the new products in the ready-to-drink tea market in 2016 when compared to competitors. The new green tea also contributed to an overall increase in sales of products in the Oishi group, resulting in a 23% increase in revenue in the 380 ml. market (data from January-September 2016).

## Rock Mountain Soda Water

ThaiBev has launched a new soda product under the “Rock Mountain” brand. The new product uses cold infusion technology in the production process allowing the soda to remain fizzy longer. According to consumer research, the product has received very positive feedback, as consumers like the packaging design and are especially satisfied with the improved effervescence which, when mixed with drinks, gives a more satisfying taste.

# Responsible Sourcing

ThaiBev applies the three key SEP principles – Moderation, Reasonableness, and Prudence together with SEP’s two key values, Knowledge and Virtue – throughout its supply chain management to mitigate risk and create positive economic, environmental, and social outcomes.

ThaiBev focuses on building capacity for its suppliers to establish a circular economy; resulting in a supply chain that minimizes environmental impact, generates employment and income in local communities, and stimulates the national economy.

## ThaiBev’s Business Partner Conference 2016

![Business Partner Conference](image)

- **Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Management, Mr. Kosit Suksingha**, delivered an opening speech at ThaiBev’s Business Partner Conference 2016 on the subject “Supply Chain Sustainability”.

- **The President of Purchasing and Supply Chain Management Association of Thailand, Mr. Anant Srithinavibul**, was one of the guest speakers at ThaiBev’s Business Partner Conference 2016. His topic of discussion was “Supplier Collaboration: A Key to Business Success.”

- **Representatives from the Supplier Award Working Team** formally announce the kick-off of the Supplier Award Program at ThaiBev’s Business Partner Conference 2016.

The core of a sustainable supply chain at ThaiBev involves delivering high quality and valuable products to consumers, while maintaining responsibility towards stakeholders under the principles of good governance. From Sourcing, Production, Distribution, Marketing and Sales, to Post-Consumption Packaging Management, ThaiBev values its suppliers as critical stakeholders in the journey towards long-term mutual growth. With this in mind, ThaiBev emphasizes capacity development for its partners in order to foster strong and sustainable business relations. In 2016, various activities and mechanisms were initiated to facilitate cooperation on sustainable development and business practices for suppliers.

### 2020 Target

- **100%** of suppliers operate in compliance with ThaiBev’s Supplier Code of Practice.

# Managing Sustainable Sourcing Risks

To ensure that consumers receive safe and high-quality products, ThaiBev places a strong focus on raw material sourcing by enforcing strict measures on safety testing for all raw materials that enter the production process, including its material properties, toxicity and contamination levels, and any use of Genetically Modified Organisms.

In addition to quality, ThaiBev has incorporated a sustainability factor into the selection process of raw materials suppliers, namely, suppliers’ environmental impact management, employment policies, and ethical business practices. Potential suppliers must register with the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) website, which requires them to accept the ThaiBev Supplier Code of Practice and conduct a self-evaluation survey on sustainability. Only those who pass this initial screening process will enter the next stage of the pre-qualification process prior to being deemed suitable suppliers for ThaiBev Group.

# Creating Sustainable Suppliers

After the screening and pre-qualification process, compliance with the Supplier Code of Practice is required as one of the conditions for a contract between ThaiBev and its suppliers. A review and compliance monitoring process have been established, where ThaiBev highly trained auditors and procurement staff conduct on-site audits at suppliers’ business operations; a standardized goods inspection procedure was also developed to streamline processes. In order to rank suppliers according to performance scores, the procurement working team collects and reviews supplier performance on an annual basis and classifies these scores. Non-compliant or underperforming suppliers must develop a corrective action plan to be completed within a predefined period, or risk contract probation or termination. In 2016, 100% of audited suppliers complied with ThaiBev’s Supplier Code of Practice, and 55% were ranked as Class A or high-performing suppliers.

ThaiBev also undertakes an annual supplier risk assessment in order to identify high-risk suppliers that require special attention and periodic on-site audits, as determined by audit protocol. In 2016, 18% of critical suppliers were audited on-site.

## Supplier Code of Practice

In order to solidify the Company’s dedication to sustainable business practices, ThaiBev announced the Supplier Code of Practice as a working guideline for its suppliers. The Code of Practice ensures smooth transactions and mutual benefits between ThaiBev and its suppliers, and stipulates requirements on business ethics, environmental management, human rights, as well as occupational health and safety. Following the announcement process, the first phase of application requires suppliers to accept and submit their signed acknowledgment of the Supplier Code of Practice to ThaiBev Group.

## Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM)

In 2016, ThaiBev formally launched the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) website to reduce the time required for sourcing and procurement, and to increase competitiveness through the use of an automated system to mobilize the procurement process. The website serves as a registration tool for new suppliers, an ordering channel with current suppliers, and a communications channel between ThaiBev and its suppliers. Suppliers can also gain access to ThaiBev’s sustainability policies on various issues through the website, including the Supplier Code of Practice, Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) Guideline, Sustainable Agriculture Guideline, and Packaging Guideline. Following its launch, the initial effectiveness of the new website was assessed by evaluating responses from registered users, and by comparing the reduction in timeframe for the sourcing-to-payment process against the usual manual carrier service. For more information, visit the SLCM website at [http://slcm.thaibev.com/](http://slcm.thaibev.com/).


# Capability Development for Suppliers

ThaiBev initiated the Supplier Award Program to promote capability development, competitiveness, and innovation within the industry. An Award Committee and Working Team were established for the program, comprising various functions across ThaiBev, to instill confidence among both the Company’s staff and suppliers in the fairness and transparency of the process. Data on supplier performance are collected and reviewed quarterly for evaluation.

In 2016, ThaiBev formally launched the Supplier Award Program and invited all critical suppliers to participate, with the aim to expand the program to other suppliers in the future and to provide opportunities for them to showcase their potential and grow alongside ThaiBev. The awarded suppliers are eligible for a potentially larger purchasing volume and special supplier training programs, as well as meetings with high-level executives to exchange views and visions for business management and transformation.

# Strengthening Domestic Economy through Local Sourcing

ThaiBev supports the sourcing of materials from local suppliers in order to generate local employment. ThaiBev believes that a strong national economy begins with income distribution that allows local communities to be self-reliant. As a result, ThaiBev focuses on sourcing from areas in the proximity of its production sites, which provides the advantage of generating local employment and delivering added value for local materials, and additionally minimizes pollution from transportation.

## Percentage of Procurement from Local Suppliers

| Year | Percentage (%) | Number of Suppliers | Purchase Value |
|------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 2012 | 83%            |                     |                |
| 2013 | 77%            |                     |                |
| 2014 | 91%            |                     |                |
| 2015 | 92%            |                     |                |
| 2016 | 87%            |                     |                |

## 2020 Target

**95%** of total group procurement ratio sourced from local suppliers*

*Note: 
- Local supplier refers to a group of suppliers who operate their business in the country where ThaiBev Group’s base of operation is located, and have direct business relations with ThaiBev Group.
- Information for the years 2012-2014 covers the procurement of goods and services by ThaiBev, and the network of companies in which ThaiBev holds 100% stakes (excluding Oishi, Sermsuk or other international companies).
- Information for the year 2015-2016 covers procurement of goods and services by ThaiBev and companies under the ThaiBev in Thailand group.
- Information for the year 2016 covers the period from January 2016 to September 2016 due to the change of ThaiBev Group’s fiscal year policy.

# Supplier’s Water-related Risks

As a beverage manufacturer, water is a vital element of ThaiBev’s production process requiring thorough attention and management. Aside from managing water resources from the manufacturing process, ThaiBev also assesses critical suppliers’ water-related risks using the Global Water Tool (GWT) and Water Resource Review (WRR). The assessment covers supplier’s water management policies, water stress levels, and stakeholder conflicts.

In 2016, ThaiBev assessed all of its critical suppliers on water-related risk issues, and only one of them has been identified as at risk. However, the identified supplier has a corporate water efficiency policy in place, and further operates in compliance with respective government’s water management practice. Nevertheless, ThaiBev has sought alternative suppliers and limited allocation of volume to the high-risk supplier in order to properly mitigate production risk.


# Eco-friendly Packaging

ThaiBev focuses on the development of packaging that meets consumers’ demands and takes environmental impacts into account. Based upon the belief that good packaging not only protects the product and attracts consumers through beautiful design, but also generates minimum waste and pollution, ThaiBev applies the 3Rs principle and strictly adheres to the Company’s requirements in developing eco-friendly packaging.

## Reduce

- **Reduce paper used in packaging processes up to**: 62.3 Metric tons per year
- **Reduce greenhouse gas emissions of**: 1,329 Metric tons CO₂e
- **Reduce usage of plastics**: 461 Metric tons per year

ThaiBev undertook various activities to reduce the use of packaging in various product groups, such as changing and reducing the size of corrugated papers. This is an expansion of a practice initiated in 2011 to cover a wider range of products, both for domestic and international distribution. Two initiatives have been added in the Alcoholic Beverages group. When expansion is complete, ThaiBev expects to reduce the amount of paper used in its production by 62.3 metric tons per year, equivalent to greenhouse gas reduction of 115 metric tons of CO₂e. Another initiative includes reducing the weight of plastic used for water bottles of all sizes. This approach helped to reduce plastic in the manufacturing process annually by 461 metric tons, which is the equivalent of reducing 1,329 metric tons CO₂e.

## 3Rs

### Reuse

- **1,575,159,217** Bottles
- **Reuse Increase**: 50% from 2015

In 2016, ThaiBev has reused 1,575,159,217 glass bottles in its manufacturing, packaging processes, and production of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks. This is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 1,401,892 metric tons CO₂e. ThaiBev has also designed glass bottles for soft drinks to be more long-lasting, so that they can be reused up to 50 times per bottle. In the previous 4 years until 2016 ThaiBev had reused glass bottles for soft drinks 25 times, the equivalent to recycling 1,580 million bottles, and reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 1,495,200 metric tons CO₂e.

### Recycle Glass

- **21,615** Metric tons
- **22,092** Metric tons

Given that glass bottles constitute the Company’s main packaging item, over the past year, 21,615 metric tons of cullet were recycled in the manufacturing process, an equivalent of reducing greenhouse emissions by 17,424 metric tons CO₂e. This includes partition paper and shredded paper, at the amount of 22,092 metric tons, an equivalent of reducing greenhouse emissions by 64,730 metric tons CO₂e.

## Returnable Bottles

In order to promote consumer participation in post-consumer waste reduction, ThaiBev established 46 glass bottles collection centers across the country, with a total of 1,544 staff at all locations. In 2016, ThaiBev collected 1,155,159,217 bottles for re-packaging, reducing greenhouse gas emission by 1,028,092 metric tons CO₂e.

## 2020 Target

- **80%** of main packaging is reused, recycled, and reclaimed.

# Governance, Risk, and Compliance

> "To achieve desired results that are also beneficial and morally just, you need more than just knowledge: You need honesty, sincerity, and justice. Knowledge is the engine that propels the vehicle. Moral principles are the steering wheel or rudder that lead the vehicle safely in the right direction."
> 
> — His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 8 July 1967

ThaiBev is dedicated to running its business with the honesty and integrity espoused by SEP. We also apply the SEP principle of Prudence to prevent negative impacts to prepare for change and reduce risk.

## Good Corporate Governance

ThaiBev is committed to the principles of good governance and conducting business through an effective, transparent, and accountable management system. This involves not only operating under the rule of law and regulations, but demonstrating a commitment to leading by example in professional excellence, transparency, and good governance. We believe that such an approach creates trust for our shareholders, investors, employees, customers, and all relevant parties and stakeholders.

ThaiBev publishes our Corporate Governance Report in the 2016 Annual Report, which provides an overview of the company’s structure and processes pertaining to the disclosure of governance-related information. The Report further details information on company performance, future business opportunities, and approaches by which the Board of Directors, Management, and shareholders implement sustainable development to create a competitive advantage. ThaiBev’s commitment to sustainable business growth for our customers and to creating long-term value for our shareholders is also demonstrated through our consideration of both internal and external stakeholder interests.

Furthermore, ThaiBev has developed and announced use of the Whistleblowing (Grievance) Policy as a way to emphasize the importance of receiving and responding to grievances both inside and outside the organization. In 2016, there were no significant incidents of conflict found, and no significant cases of grievances related to ethics which were investigated and found to be valid.

ThaiBev has developed plans to provide annual training on the laws and regulations of the Singapore Stock Exchange to our Board Members, Management, and employees from relevant functions in ThaiBev Group, to be hosted by the Compliance Unit, Office of the Corporate Secretariat. Any changes or amendments to the aforementioned laws and regulations will be reported during meetings of the Board of Directors, or through e-mail as deemed necessary.

## Business Code of Conduct

ThaiBev’s Business Codes of Conduct serve as important standards in encouraging the ethical conduct of all individuals, in compliance with laws, and company values and morals. The Board of Directors, Management, and employees all have the responsibility to accept and strictly adhere to the values espoused in our Codes of Conduct with integrity. Moreover, all individuals are required to observe ethical conduct according to the Corporate Governance Policy. Such practices will enable ThaiBev to maintain its responsibility to all stakeholders which include society as a whole and the Singapore Exchange. ThaiBev’s Codes of Conduct comprise four important and intersecting areas.

# Anti-Corruption

Good governance lays the foundation for strong legal compliance. With this in mind, ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy sets robust measures to protect against corruption and serves as guidelines in business conduct and risk management for a sustainable future. Board members, management, and employees must adhere to this policy and are also responsible for upholding it to the highest standards. They assume an important role in providing consultations in the case of suspicious activity and refraining from corruption of all forms – direct and indirect – related to ThaiBev’s businesses and functions in all countries of operation. The President and CEO has the duty to monitor and implement a robust and efficient anti-corruption system and report to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee and Internal Control Committee. In any case of corruption, guilty parties will undergo a disciplinary hearing process. Once the relevant committee completes its investigation as required, the responsible party will receive punishment according to ThaiBev’s regulations on inappropriate behavior and conduct violations. In the case that a corrupt practice is also a legal violation, the responsible party may be subject to further legal action.

  - **Talent Assessment**

Supervisors plan regular assessment dates throughout the year, after which employees and supervisors review performances and develop their expertise through coaching and feedback. Finally, year-end assessment of work and potential for development is used to consider staff career paths, promotions, reassignments, transfers, other possible benefits, the selection and development of outstanding members of staff, and to identify key paths for succession.

# Employee Training and Development

ThaiBev has formalized a systematic learning process that improves work skills and is applicable to the real work situation. Additionally, staff are expected to develop a positive attitude and good behavior that can leave sustainable impacts on both the staff and the organization. In order to achieve these goals, the principle of 70:20:10 was incorporated into human capital development programs.

- **70%** is learning from experiences, expansion of responsibility, authority, and decision power, new tasks, project-based work, and learning-by-doing.
- **20%** is learning through coaching, instruction, and advice received from experts in the field, as well as community of practice or experience sharing.
- **10%** is formal learning in classes, seminars, or the company’s e-learning tools.

## Training Preparation

In preparation for the year 2016 training, executives held meetings with relevant departments on the Training Roadmap for various levels of staff and their Individual Development Plan: IDP, which was developed based on communications between staff and supervisors after the annual evaluation. To attend training courses employees can self-register online and then submit the request to their supervisors for approval. Supervisors of all ranks have the obligation to support and ensure that their staff attend their scheduled training.

### Learning Management System (LMS)

- **Online Registration**
- **Class Scheduler**
- **Course Management**
- **Self-Service**
- **Reports**

Additionally, the Learning Management System was developed to increase the efficiency of human capital development. After staff submit an online request for training, the information is then collected to organize class timetables. Registration through application, online evaluation, and online staff database ensure accuracy and comprehensive information that allows for access to the data.


# Human Capital Development Roadmap

In 2016, the company established the Human Capital Development Roadmap for employees, with the goal of improving the capability of the staff. The staff and executives were categorized into three groups:

- **The Oceans**: Senior Influencers
- **The Rivers**: Middle Management
- **The Spring & Streams**: Individual Contributors

## Investment in Staff Training

- **142.69 Million Baht**: Investment in capability building program for staff
- **16 Hours**: Average number of staff training hours

*Average number of staff training hours refers to staff of all levels from ThaiBev Group — excluding Senior executives, advisors, and temporary staff.


# The Human Capital Development Roadmap Consists of Four Groups

### Leadership Competency Development Program
For all leaders, based on the Five Levels of Leadership, namely Responsibility / Relationship / Result / Reproduction / Respect.

### Core Competency Development Program
Aims to develop management skills, knowledge, and capability with the aim of improving four core competencies for ThaiBev’s staff, namely Communication, Collaboration, Speed, and Result.

### Functional Competency Development Program
Aims to enhance skill sets for staff among all levels and departments such as computer training and language-training courses.

### Transformational Development Program
Available for all staff. The objective of the program is to equip the employee with resilience when faced with changes in both the organization and in their personal life by suggesting an appropriate mindset and rules of engagement.



# All Human Capital Development Programs Are Evaluated with Various Methodologies in Order to Ensure their Effectiveness. The Evaluation Process Has Four Aspects:

### Employee Feedback
Measures the participants’ satisfaction in various aspects in order to improve the program both in terms of content and organization.

### Learning Outcome
Measures the participants’ changes in understanding, attitudes, and aptitude as a result of the training.

### Application
Measures the changes in the staff’s working behavior and career progression as a result of applying their training to their tasks.

### Impact on Business
Measures the staff’s positive effect on business activities and operations. For certain long-term training programs such as the Management Development Program, there are group projects that were designed to represent real work situations, the result of which is used both during and after the program.

# ThaiBev Scholarship

One of the "Limitless Opportunities" at ThaiBev is evident through the fact that employees learn from firsthand experience, along with knowledge and expertise sharing between employees from different generations. Additionally, they have the opportunity to pursue further education through seven master degree scholarships offered. In one year, there are five scholarships in English and Chinese programs from leading institutes in Thailand and two scholarships abroad for countries like the U.S., the U.K., Australia, China, and Singapore. This allows employees to broaden their views and increase their knowledge while exchanging experiences, perspectives, and ideas with external parties.

Since 2015, the company has granted six scholarships to employees. These comprise three national scholarships, one for a doctorate program in biotechnology at the Faculty of Agro-Industry, Kasetsart University, two scholarships for Sasin Chula Engineering Dual MBA and Master of Engineering program, Chulalongkorn University. Three more scholarships for international study are awarded, which include a Master of Business Administration (MBA) at Australian National University (Canberra, Australia), Master of Business Administration (MBA) at University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, Scotland), and Master of International Financial Analysis at The University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland).

Scholarship recipients can undertake research and dissertations under topics of interest and apply the knowledge and experience they gained from these studies for the benefit of the organization. They can also attend field visits to related organizations which belong to the Company in that country in order to grow their understanding of the diverse nature of the Company’s businesses. They can also share experiences, viewpoints, and challenges from their study abroad with other employees in the Company.

# Case Study: Leadership Building Program through Coaching Culture

Building ThaiBev Coaching Culture for Achieving Vision 2020 is one of ThaiBev’s leadership journeys. The Company developed the Coaching & Technique for Breakthrough Results Program (CTBR) for executives, to create a coaching culture at work, which will contribute to the achievement of ThaiBev’s Vision 2020. One-on-one executive coaching and CTBR workshops were held for "The Oceans" executives. The workshop is aimed to expand for "The Rivers" executives throughout the organization to generate an understanding that the heart of coaching is to empower the staff to reach their full potential and see the opportunities available to them. The staff would then be inspired to utilize their full potential, improve teamwork, perform at their highest ability, and find success in both their personal lives and career.


# Success Indicators in terms of Adapting “Coaching” for the Organization

“After attending “The Oceans” group workshop, the executives began using the coaching techniques in their team management. One of the business executives who was responsible for developing the turnaround plan employed the coaching technique and was able to reduce the costs of doing business, utilize the staff’s full capability, and produce higher quality works. The changes caused the profits to increase threefold despite the economic recession. Another executive who is in charge of sales adapted the coaching technique to the work and doubled the sales numbers very quickly. Additionally, the staff’s loyalty and teamwork grew stronger.”

Interview of Mr. Paisarn Aowsathaporn (Executive Vice President of food business, Oishi Group Public Co., Ltd.) and Ms. Nopamars Vattanalianigai (Acting Managing Director, HORECA Management Co., Ltd.)



Because of the success demonstrated by various executives that utilized the experiences from the CTBR Program in their team, ThaiBev aims to create a sustainable coaching culture by developing the Train the Trainer Program to establish the executives as the role model of coaching and unlock the full potential of the staff. In 2016, five executives of the Oceans group were chosen to attend the ‘Train the Trainer’ program to become certified trainers to coach ThaiBev employees. In September 2016, the five certified internal trainers held workshops for over 330 “the Rivers” executives. All of “the Rivers” level executives are expected to complete the training by the first half of 2017. The certified internal trainers have reduced the training expense by 80% in comparison to training by external institutes. In 2017, ThaiBev plans to expand the training program to the subsidiaries in Singapore and Malaysia and develop a ‘Train Master Trainer’ Program to help the certified internal trainers create the next generation of leaders as coaches.

Beside the Coaching & Technique for Breakthrough Results Program, ThaiBev developed a continuation program for leaders known as “the Leader’s Daily Role in Engaging People & Talent” Program, which adapts the coaching skills into practical measures that help create business output and improve staff relationships in a continuous manner.

Additionally, in order to create a learning environment and support high potential staff, ThaiBev will host a Community of Practice Program in 2017 for the staff who completed the CTBR Program to provide a platform for executives to share their experiences and learn from each other. The ‘Master Trainer’ or certified internal coach would also participate as co-trainers. The program will contribute to the creation of a sustainable coaching culture and a meaningful result that supports Vision 2020.


# Case Study: Work Efficiency Development Program

## The 4 Disciplines of Execution

Thai Beverage Logistics Co., Ltd. (TBL) began the 4 Disciplines of Execution in June 2015. The company appointed 12 4DX Implementation Managers and five coaches. In each region, the 4DX was launched in 45 warehouses and two distribution centers and transportation centers. Additionally, the 4DX Contests were launched for Best Result, Best Scoreboard & The Most Effective WIG Meeting. As a result, in 2015, TBL reduced expenses by 1,029,000 baht, through a reduction of fuel costs and damaged products.

In 2016, TBL expanded on this success by covering a network of 68 warehouses and two distribution centers and transportation centers under the “4DX Trim-tab Certification” program. Six trainers were appointed to broaden the result to cover all warehouses, distribution centers, and transportation centers in all provinces, as well as all 3,800 staff. The program also recognized the warehouses that met their monthly goal from logistical costs management, which reduced the costs by 11,336,000 baht per year. Additionally, the program inspired changes in staff behavior to become more consistent with the company’s four disciplines, which would lead to sustainability and achievement of Vision 2020’s goal to create professionalism throughout ThaiBev.

### The 4 Disciplines

1. **Focus on the Wildly Important**
2. **Act on the Lead Measures**
3. **Keep a Compelling Scoreboard**
4. **Create a Cadence of Accountability**

# Talent Management

Talent management is one of the key focuses continuously undertaken by ThaiBev and its subsidiaries in order to cope with high growth and to ensure the Company's status as a stable and sustainable industry leader. The training program, which focuses on outstanding employees, was developed in conjunction with leading institutes in both Thailand and abroad to ensure that the content meets international standards. The focus is on practical action-learning projects that can benefit the growth of the business and networking opportunities for the staff from various departments and subsidiaries, both within and outside of Thailand in order to facilitate cross-functional collaboration. The program is also aimed at promoting employee engagement through participation, experience and advice sharing from high-level executives, thus fostering a learning environment for all.

# Rocket Project

The Rocket Project originated from ThaiBev’s belief and vision for 2030, in which the Company aims to have high-level executives or CEOs of 45 years old or younger by 2030. The initiative aims to serve as a platform for opportunities among the new generation of talented staff who are committed to growing alongside ThaiBev over the next 20 years. The project is another testament on the importance of maintaining talents and following ThaiBev principle of “Limitless Opportunities.” Staff chosen to participate are given opportunities to learn new skills, perform challenging tasks, increase their potential, and improve their leadership skills to prepare for opportunities to become high-level executives in the future.

![Rocket Project Image](image_url)

# Special Program for Outstanding Staff

Many programs are developed for outstanding staff, which cover Global Business Acumen and Mindset and Behavior Development. The training is available for employees of all levels, including:

- Top Executive Development Program
- Global Leadership Development Program
- Management Development Program (MDP)
- Capability Building for Employees

ThaiBev also supports higher education for high potential employees by providing scholarship programs for Master’s Degree both in Thailand and overseas. Staff who received the funding were able to learn from their experiences working for ThaiBev and bring back their expertise to benefit the company through consultation with the high-level executives.


# Employee Engagement

To further embed into ThaiBev management culture the ethos that employees are the Company's most important assets, Human Capital has worked closely with line managers to identify and implement the "Top 3 Initiatives" to further enhance employee engagement. Among the key initiatives are the "Power of Clarity" program, a structured talent review and succession planning, and the facilitation of personalized communication via new innovative channels.

The progress of these initiatives is closely monitored and reported to senior executives on a regular basis, as ThaiBev strongly believes that a high rate of employee engagement will lead to the long-term sustainability of ThaiBev itself as well to the employee personal and career fulfillment.

# Performance Management as Driver of Employee Engagement

Reflecting on the biggest area for improvement from the previous employee engagement survey, ThaiBev in 2016 embarked on multiple efforts to achieve greater level of clarity and alignment throughout all levels of employees. The central focus was on performance management where ThaiBev increased the evaluation frequency from annual to biannual evaluations.

In order to become a highly efficient organization, and achieve consistent policy and approach among groups and subsidiaries, constant reviews of operational results and outputs are necessary. ThaiBev increased the evaluation frequency from annual to biannual evaluations (mid-year and end of the year). The whole business must share common goals, with various weight given to different departments. The evaluation includes weighting between the performance and behavioral evaluation. The changes in these evaluation criteria and practices have contributed to concrete business outcomes.

Since quality and clarity of the set goal is one of the main enabling factors for success, ThaiBev organized a "Power of Clarity" program. The project aimed to clarify the linkages between the organization goal and staff's goal on all levels, which would contribute to the achievement of both goals.

Furthermore, the Sustainable Development Indicators and People Development Indicators were introduced as a part of the criteria, weighting 10% each for middle management level and above. This is a reaffirmation of the crucial role that ThaiBev’s staff play in developing and leading the organization to sustainability.

After the regular evaluation, the supervisors and the staff then developed a personal career development goal, which has the main objective of connecting the staff’s career aspiration to the organization goal. This system was constructed to help create sustainable development for both the employee and the organization, as well as to generate an organization goal that is consistent with the staff’s career path.



![Journey towards "Goals and Clarity" with "Limitless Opportunities"](image.png)

# ThaiBev’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

In 2016, ThaiBev established the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), an additional share-based incentive provided to high-performing employees who make significant contributions to the Company for achieving superior performance. This is particularly important for the Company so that it can continue to perform excellently.

The LTIP is aimed at retaining, motivating, and rewarding employees who continue to work for the long-term benefit of the Company and shareholders, especially with greater dedication and loyalty. The LTIP, in force for a period of 5 years, is designed to improve employees’ long-term performance by giving rewards tied to individual contribution, efficiency enhancement and sustainability development. Through the LTIP, the Company provides an opportunity for employees to participate in the equity of the Company, thereby promoting a stronger sense of identification with its sustained profitability, fostering commitment towards the Company’s success, as well as greater ownership within the organization. The LTIP will help create sustainable value and future benefit to the Company, increasing overall ThaiBev’s competitiveness.

The LTIP commences in performance year 2016 and will continue annually over the next 5 years until 2020. It will help to create incentives for employees to achieve the 2020 targets. Additionally, for each initial share grant, there will be performance conditions linked to future company performance which include both financial and sustainability aspects to further align key employees to the importance of sustainable performance.

# Succession Planning

In order to carry out sustainable development and business continuation to reach the Vision 2020, ThaiBev constructed succession plans for important positions, beginning with high-level executives. The Company has the policy of internal succession priority. Succession planning began with identifying crucial positions on the organizational strategic plan and constructing a prototype profile for each position. The profile includes details on work experiences, job description, responsibility, as well as skills, knowledge, and expertise required for the position. The next step is to evaluate and select staff who best fit the criteria and desired characteristics of the profile, in order to begin a development plan for the chosen staff. The selection process takes into consideration both the performance and the career aspiration of the staff in order to create a sustainable sense of belonging among the staff.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

In addition to the aforementioned operation, ThaiBev has developed a Five-Year Human Capital Development Plan in support of the Vision 2020. The Plan adjusts the organization structure and operations to be more consistent with the strategies of the business group and the overall management approach. The Company also understands the importance of investing in information technologies and aims to create uniformity among all subsidiaries, which includes the establishment of the Human Capital Dashboard for monitoring and reporting on the HC’s performance, as well as to provide suggestions on Human Capital development and management for the executives.

ThaiBev cares for its staff from their very first day of work until the very last, and can be considered a family. ThaiBev has prepared a retiree community for all its employees close to retirement to partake in happily, and to create a foundation for relationships between current employees and retirees. ThaiBev helps to train staff to look after each other, the society and economy, and further train elders about part-time work and activities that can be carried out after retirement, such as baking, cooking, weaving, how to administer savings, and carry out investments.

Once an employee reaches retiring age, ThaiBev sees the importance of their accumulated knowledge, skills and abilities, and may consider some who are still fit and desire to work, on a year-by-year basis. The remaining retirees are given pensions that amount to no less than that outlined by the government. In 2016 there are 181 retirees above the age of 60 years who continue to work with ThaiBev.

## Labor Practices and Human Rights

ThaiBev leads by the heart, and has always upheld the importance of respecting employees and its stakeholders. The Company fully follows the principles of human rights and labor laws and standards in all areas where the business operates. Furthermore, ThaiBev strictly conforms with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Therefore, ThaiBev has developed a human rights policy, which was formally launched in 2016, in order to reiterate its strong position against discrimination and violations. ThaiBev also took a stand against forced labor and child labor, and supported rights of associations and rights of decent working hours, in order to provide its staff with a work-life balance, as well as occupational health and safety at work.

ThaiBev has communicated all these principles and rights to the staff during the ThaiBev Conference and ThaiBev Expo in order for them to apply these principles in their daily lives and benefit their personal lives and communities. ThaiBev also welcomes opinions from every stakeholder if any case of human rights violation arises. ThaiBev also set a goal to communicate with employees through the Human Capital Department in 2017 and prepare orientation programs for all new staff to ensure that this policy is applied effectively.

Aside from the human rights policy, ThaiBev has incorporated the human rights principle into the Supplier Code of Practice, which was also conveyed during the ThaiBev Expo.

For 2017, ThaiBev is in the consideration process regarding the completion of Human Rights Risk Assessments of pilot sites, which will be completed by 2020.

# Occupational Health and Safety

> "Good physical health is a factor supporting economic progress and the social security of the country because it leads to good mental health. Physical and mental fitness enable the individual to effectively serve the nation while refraining from imposing burdens on the nation."
>
> — His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 22 October 1979

ThaiBev cares for its employees by following the SEP principles of Moderation and Prudence in the workplace, ensuring that worker health and safety is maintained in all situations and for all positions.

ThaiBev believes that no asset is more important than determined and dedicated employees. They are the fundamental force shaping ThaiBev’s success. The Company has therefore developed the Quality, Safety, Health, and Environment Policy (QSHE) as a critical mechanism in improving operational effectiveness and efficiency. ThaiBev fosters constructive, creative mindsets among its management executives, employees, and ThaiBev Group subsidiaries as a way towards practical implementation of safety management, accomplished through clearly defined targets, strategies, projects, and performance monitoring indicators. Starting at ThaiBev and expanding to other ThaiBev business groups (including beer, spirits, and non-alcoholic beverages) and covering relevant business functions and operations. All in all, the highest-level management of each subsidiary must adopt and apply the QSHE policy as a framework in their respective companies. Furthermore, they are required to define procedures, performance indicators, and monitor and assess performance according to the QSHE Policies of ThaiBev and its subsidiaries.

## Compliance with Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations and International Standards in the Workplace

ThaiBev is currently developing a safety manual to cover activities, starting with designating a safety officer at personnel levels (Chief Officer, Technical Officer, Vocational Officer, and Management Officer), who will be registered with the Provincial Bureau of Labor Protection and Welfare. Once they carry out all safety measures as required by law and international standards the company must prepare a report on the performance of its vocational safety officers to send for government and management to review.

### Organizational Structure

- **Chairman** (Employee Representative at the Management Level) and Executive Committee
- **Operational Committee**
- **Vocational Safety Officers** (Serving as Committee Members and Secretariat)

# Case Study: Safety Management at Thai Beverage Logistics Co., Ltd. (TBL)

TBL provides safety knowledge-building courses for employees, with courses that are legally required, as well as those that go beyond legal requirements. These include:

- Training for safety officers
- Basic first-aid training and patient moving and handling
- Basic fire and evacuation training
- Advanced fire training for safety officers and emergency response teams
- Defensive driving for logistics personnel
- Safe driving training for forklift trucks

![TBL Truck](image)

## Mitigating Social Impacts through QSHE Management

TBL does not solely consider employee safety in its operations but also demonstrates concern for any potential impacts that may arise from TBL’s logistics activities on society at large and third-party individuals. Various measures have been designed to protect against such impacts, including:

- Monitoring the blood alcohol concentration of company drivers prior to carrying out their responsibilities
- Drug-testing at the workplace
- Route inspections prior to journeys
- Specifying driving speed limits
- Providing rest areas for drivers to reduce accident risks

![TBL Integrated OHS Dashboard](image)

For the long-term, the TBL Management remains committed to building capacity in occupational health and safety by operating in accordance with its QSHE policy, which can also be considered an important risk management mechanism. Furthermore, TBL develops performance targets and evaluates results at each level to determine the company’s occupational health, safety, and environmental standard.

# Responsible Consumption

**ThaiBev encourages its customers and product providers to exercise the key SEP principle of Moderation when consuming or distributing alcoholic beverage products, in the name of consumer health and the health of all.**

As a manufacturer and distributor of alcoholic beverages, ThaiBev strives to promote responsible alcoholic-beverage consumption and to continue to raise the awareness for alcohol drinkers. ThaiBev continuously operates towards this mission by encouraging responsible drinking among consumers; this has included constant campaigning. Additionally, ThaiBev places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all marketing communications and services strictly comply with the law.

## Operation and Control

ThaiBev manufactures and distributes alcoholic beverages as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), adhering to the self-regulatory guidance since 2015. ThaiBev operates through the cooperation of core parties—namely, producers, distributors, representatives from government sectors and non-profit organizations—to achieve alignment with the Code of Conduct in the administration of manufacturing and distributing alcoholic beverages, in order to determine explicit operational guidelines for related parties and also to make certain of their accountability to convey quality marketing communications and encourage responsible consumption.

![Serve Responsibly Logo](serve_responsibly_logo.png)

**Serve Responsibly Project**

In the year 2016, in order to encourage responsible consumption, ThaiBev launched the Serve Responsibly Project, which is one of the recognized procedures under the Self-Regulation Organization (SRO). This project aims to increase the accountability of providers when they serve alcoholic beverages to consumers. The primary objective of the project is to minimize the risk of accidents resulting from excess alcoholic consumption, which may cause harm to the life or property of the consumer.

In order to fulfill this goal, a training workshop called “Serve Responsibly” has been arranged for alcoholic-beverage providers, firstly targeting ThaiBev’s main alliances, such as hotel and premium restaurant runners. To this end, ThaiBev invited them to enroll their employees who serve alcohol such as food and beverage managers or bar managers to the workshop.



**This trademark as required by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, B.E. 2551, and related laws is strictly displayed, with no violations recorded during the year 2016.**

# The Workshop Highlights

The workshop highlights activities that encourage service providers to become more responsible alcoholic-beverages providers. The workshop is comprised of 3 main parts, namely:

## 1. Theoretical Knowledge

This consists of:

1.1 Knowledge of the manufacturing process and active ingredients for each alcoholic product.

1.2 Knowledge of the laws and regulations as stipulated in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. Emphasis on alcoholic-beverage sale and consumption control, including direct experiences related from law-enforcement officers, i.e., the police.

1.3 Medical knowledge on the proper amount of alcohol consumption for the human body, including the effects of over-consumption.

1.4 Safety knowledge for minimizing the risks of consuming alcoholic beverages.

## 2. "DernMaoMun" (Walking Drunk) Workshop

This part features a core tool called "Drunk Buster Goggles," also known as eyeglasses that simulate the experience of intoxication. These glasses replicate the visual ability, and reactions, of an intoxicated person. Trainees will be asked to wear the "Drunk Buster Goggles" and participate in activities together. The activity’s objective is to acknowledge the relative body states of pre-and post-alcoholic consumption, in order to distinguish among customers affected by alcohol; for example, by demonstrating a lack of ability to walk straight or delayed reactions to situations, etc. Additionally, the activity aims to demonstrate the effects resulting from over-consumption of alcohol such as a family-relationship breakdown, lack of self-control, violence, and harm to one’s life.

## 3. Viral Video Production

This part’s objective is to train the subconscious of the alcoholic-beverages providers by producing a short video about a regular customer who gradually tends to consume more alcohol, resulting in reduced self-control and decision-making ability. The story emphasizes that the person best positioned to help this customer is not the customer him/herself, nor family at home, nor a companion, but the restaurant or bar staff, who could help this customer to drink reasonably and prevent him/her from harmful situations. This message should be integrated as a daily work principle.

### Information in the Curriculum for 'Serve Responsibly'

"Serve Responsibly" is a three-year project, featuring three training workshops each year, commencing in December 2016. As previously mentioned, in the first year, the project will target hotel and premium restaurant runners in Bangkok. In the next year, the project will expand to the Bangkok perimeter provinces and upcountry provinces.

The key performance indicator of this project is that in three years, there must be at least 150 hotel and premium restaurant runners participating, with not less than 300 trainees. Additionally, there will be a yearly performance review involving a discussion with trainees who have completed the course, evaluating them each year. ThaiBev strongly expects that once trainees have accomplished the "Serve Responsibly" course, they will not only acquire theoretical knowledge and an understanding of responsible service, but possess the qualities of conscientious service staff. As a matter of fact, unexpected accidents from over-consumption of alcohol would be reduced if all service providers emphasized accountability in service towards consumers, resulting in the advancement of ThaiBev as a true Self-Regulatory Organization.


# Responsible Consumption for Road Safety

ThaiBev continually places emphasis on responsible consumption for road safety, because the Company is aware that one of the key factors of loss and harm in traffic accidents is irresponsible, alcohol-influenced behavior, which also poses a burden on Thai society, economically and socially. Therefore, creative and consistent communication through all media has been arranged by ThaiBev to fulfill its mission of encouraging Responsible Consumption, by collaborating with government and private sectors on the campaigns.

## Taxi Back Ads Project

Since ThaiBev has realized the great significance of road safety, media on the road—namely, advertisements on public transportation—represent an effective channel for reminding commuters to practice discipline on the roads. ThaiBev has selected media on the back of public-service vehicles—i.e., taxis—to be one of the communication channels. Since taxis do not operate on fixed routes, the opportunity to see them is more frequent and the audience is diversified. Taxi ads have been executed for ThaiBev’s road safety campaign for nine years, since 2007. Currently, 300 taxis with campaign advertisements are operating across the Bangkok metropolitan region.


# In Cooperation with the Thai Alcohol Beverage Business Association (TABBA)

ThaiBev strictly complies with the law and is enthusiastic to cooperate with other main operators. ThaiBev joined TABBA in sponsoring a seminar with the subject of "Alcohol Control Act: Lessons from the Media and Business Sectors" on 18 August 2016. This seminar's objective was to understand regulations, find solutions, and request the government sector to provide clearer guidelines for alcoholic-beverage advertisements, in order to build a better understanding between the government and private sector. The seminar was attended by 100 people.

### Panel Members (from left to right):
- Prof. Phijitra Sukanomho of the Communications Art Department, the Faculty of Arts, Chulalongkorn University.
- Mr. Pramarn Luangwattanawanich, a lawyer and legal expert.

# Consumer Health, Safety, and Wellbeing

ThaiBev applies Knowledge and Virtue to innovate a diversity of products in the name of consumer health, safety, and wellbeing.

Concern for consumer health, safety, and wellbeing is at the heart of food and beverage companies. Nowadays, consumers pay great attention to the nutritional value, hygiene, and safety of their foods and drinks. Even though current manufacturing technology has progressed significantly, breaches of food safety are still being reported globally. On the one hand, these reports increase consumer awareness of food safety; on the other hand, they also reduce their confidence in food manufacturing and distribution processes. Consumers have become diligent when it comes to seeking safe and high-quality products, so manufacturers and distributors must pay greater attention to these issues. ThaiBev has set “Health and Nutrition Policy” to be consistent with consumer needs and also put the importance on quality and safety in products.

Health and nutrition concerns continue to increase in importance. The world is combating non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which affect people in every corner of the world. It is one of the major health and development challenges of the 21st century. The three main diseases—namely hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes—are among the most common NCDs in Thailand and globally. Statistics from the World Health Organization indicate that Thailand is now facing the huge burden of these NCDs, as 70% of fatalities in the country are due to NCDs. This represents a major threat to human health, wellbeing, and development locally and globally. It is also now one of the Sustainable Development Goals to ensure healthy lives and to promote wellbeing for all at all ages.


# TARGET 2020

![Bottle Icon]

**67%**  
of the total non-alcoholic products sold will be healthy products

# PERFORMANCE

![Bottle Icon]

**61%**  
of the total non-alcoholic products sold were healthy products

For ThaiBev, the health of consumers directly impacts the health and success of the business. Lack of good nutrition is one of the reasons for non-communicable diseases. This is why ThaiBev has been taking proactive steps to ensure the health, safety, and wellbeing of consumers. ThaiBev is committed to delivering high quality and safe products while also investing in the research and development of healthy products, communicating with consumers transparently about the nutritional content of its products, and promoting healthy lifestyles.

To meet required consumer health and safety standards, ThaiBev has placed significant focus on product safety, from the manufacturing process to raw material sourcing. ThaiBev has a strict quality control policy and constantly reviews production standards, in terms of consumer safety, hygiene, and management, to meet an international level of excellence. The non-alcoholic beverage products have been certified with various standards, including:

- GMP & HACCP (Good Manufacturing Practice & Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point)
- ISO 22000 (Food Safety Management System)

Additionally, all of ThaiBev’s non-alcoholic beverage production sites such as Chang Drinking Water, Crystal Drinking Water, Oishi Green Tea and Oishi Chakulza, Jub Jai, 100 Plus, and est are certified by the internationally recognized standards as above-mentioned.

In order for ThaiBev to fulfill the various needs of its customers, who also have varied lifestyles, ThaiBev increased the variety of market products, for example, creating a low-sugar product for those who are more health-oriented.

## Health and Nutrition

ThaiBev has set an ambitious goal that by 2020 two thirds of the volume of non-alcoholic products sold must be healthy products. Over the past few years, ThaiBev has been focusing on developing new healthier products using a science-based approach. As a result of ThaiBev’s focus on developing sugar-free and low-sugar products in the non-alcoholic market segment, from January to September 2016, 61% of the total non-alcoholic products sold were healthy products.

Currently, approximately 28% of ready-to-drink tea products under the Oishi and Jub Jai brands are classified as low-sugar. Oishi is the first ready-to-drink tea manufacturer in Thailand which its products “Oishi Kabusecha No Sugar”, “Oishi Kabusecha Low Sugar”, “Oishi Green Tea Original”, and “Oishi Green Tea Sugar Free” were certified “Healthier Choice” from The Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University. For the soft drink segment, more than 27% of products have been oriented towards health-conscious consumers. The main product is “est free” which is a sugar-free and zero-calorie soft drink, for active lifestyles under the brand “100 Plus”. In 2016, est free and 100 Plus (all flavors) were certified approval to use the healthier choice label on both the products and on all advertisements as well.

ThaiBev also understands the importance of communications and consumer awareness on healthy products as well as their nutritional benefits. The Company is committed to informing consumers transparently about the nutritional content of the products in compliance with the laws and regulations on nutritional labelling.

# ThaiBev’s Healthy Products

## Case Study 01: Using Kabusecha Tea Leaves in Oishi Green Tea

The Kabusecha tea leaves have a different harvesting practice from any other tea leaves, as the farmers cover the crops with black cloths for seven days before the harvest. This practice preserves a greater amount of catechin nutrients in the tea, when compared to other types of tea as the catechin has not been compromised by sunlight. Catechin is the main health benefit of green tea in terms of detoxification and antioxidants.

## Case Study 02: 100 Plus

100 Plus is a caffeine-free, mineral-enriched soft drink that is well established in Malaysia and Singapore. The product is available in two flavors: lemon-lime and citrus. The 100 Plus products use steviol glycoside, which is a low-calorie, natural sugar found in stevia. This ingredient means that 100 Plus’ sugar content is 50% lower than that of a regular soft drink. In addition, it includes six added vitamins and minerals, namely dextrose, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, potassium phosphate, calcium phosphate, and citric acid, all of which provide health benefits.

# Water Stewardship

**ThaiBev follows SEP through Prudent risk management and careful management of water resources.**

Water is essential to human life, other natural resources, and vital to the Company’s own operations. Each year, as human populations continue to grow and climate change continues to cause extreme weather events like droughts and floods, the issue of water management becomes increasingly important. Businesses in the agricultural and industrial sectors as well as residential communities are likely to be challenged by water scarcity as well as extreme events such as floods. As a food and beverage producer that uses water as a primary ingredient in the manufacturing process, ThaiBev has especially committed to applying sustainable water management practices across the value chain. Thus, risk management practices for water resources management are embedded in all of the operations so that ThaiBev can proudly supply its customers with high-quality products that fulfill the customers’ needs of clean and safe drinking water, according to UN SDG 6. To fulfill this mission, ThaiBev has implemented the concept of “Achieving a Sustainable Balance for Water Resources Management”. This concept is guided by the principles of SEP, which informs ThaiBev’s strategies, decision making, and daily business operations. All ThaiBev’s businesses comply with its water resources management policy on water efficiency, and environmental and social impact minimization, and ThaiBev constantly applies new technologies to its business processes.

ThaiBev aims to reduce water withdrawal intensity from all water sources (hectoliter/hectoliter of Finished Goods) by 5% by 2020, in comparison with 2014. ThaiBev will employ the risk management framework to improve the water efficiency of ThaiBev’s manufacturing process, adopt technology and innovation to optimize ThaiBev’s water usage, and implement the 3Rs Principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) as well as comply with ISO 14046 standard on ThaiBev’s water footprint.

ThaiBev also recognizes the importance of water issues for external parties and is focused on supporting the conservation and rehabilitation of natural ecosystems in accordance with UN SDG 14 and UN SDG 15. For example, ThaiBev joined Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center, Doi Saket District, Chiang Mai Province to help rehabilitate watershed forests and replenish the water used in ThaiBev’s manufacturing process through sustainable water resources management. ThaiBev also teamed up with the Kenan Institute Asia and local communities for short-term and long-term water development projects that include cleaning up surrounding canals.

# Water Resources Risk Management

ThaiBev uses the Global Water Tool to evaluate its water shortage risk in terms of quantity and quality. This tool assesses facility locations by comparing the facility’s water consumption rate with the surrounding community’s total population. In addition, ThaiBev conducts a Water Resource Review to monitor the volume of water consumption and the quality of water in each source and compare the data to ThaiBev’s production plan up until 2020. ThaiBev’s Risk Management Committee also employs the Enterprise Risk Management Tool for making decisions on investments and other activities. In 2016, examples include the development of ground water and surface water wells to expand its water storage facilities. Furthermore, ThaiBev’s facilities in high-risk zones have joined the Federation of Thai Industries for a groundwater management project. In addition, for the vinasse treatment, ThaiBev has replaced the thermal vapor recovery system with one using mechanical vapor recovery. This new technology allows ThaiBev to reduce the water used for cooling systems and evaporation by 30%. ThaiBev has also changed 132-kW water pumps to the 75-kW model to reduce water withdrawal volume.

The current water withdrawal better suits the production capacity and increases the water efficiency of ThaiBev’s operations.

| Source                      | Proportion of Water Withdrawal (2016) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Municipal Water Supplies    | 9.4%                                  |

**Proportion of Water Withdrawal by Source in 2016**

# Reducing Water Consumption in the Manufacturing Process

In 2016, ThaiBev is assessing the water footprint and is currently expanding this water footprint assessment to products from all ThaiBev product groups.

Water withdrawal intensity was reduced by 0.949 hectoliter per hectoliter of Finished Goods (hL/hL FGs) or 12%, compared with 2014, resulting from improved water management. Furthermore, ThaiBev has implemented Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and also improved the efficiency of production processes.

## Water Withdrawal Intensity

| Year | Surface Water | Ground Water | Municipal Water Supplies | Rain Water | Total Water Withdrawal |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| 2013 | 5.689         | 1.062        | 0.195                    | 0.031      | 7.758                  |
| 2014 | 5.840         | 1.532        | 0.179                    | 0.064      | 8.215                  |

# King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Water Management

Few issues are as central to the legacy of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej as water management. Thailand commonly suffers from both drought and floods. This cycle means that there can be either too much water or too little, which makes effective water management extremely important. His Majesty the King dedicated his life to improve this situation across the country, in both urban and rural areas. The majority of his more than 4,400 royal initiated development projects were focused on irrigation, protecting watersheds, mitigating floods, and other water management projects. From these experiences, he developed his Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, which highlights the need for proper technology to be applied to create solutions that are sensitive to the environment and local communities, all in the name of economic progress. ThaiBev is inspired by His Majesty’s wisdom, virtues, and ideas and uses His Majesty’s vision to guide its own efforts to sensitively harness water resources in the name of all stakeholders.

## Water Resources Management through Stakeholder Engagement

ThaiBev has extensively assessed the quality and quantity of its water resources. In this regard, appropriate rules and regulations have been set forth accordingly to secure water availability in the future. Moreover, ThaiBev committed to minimizing the environmental and social impacts from the water used in ThaiBev’s manufacturing operations. Vigorous efforts have been invested in problem identification, root cause analysis, problem prioritization, and problem management. In addition, ThaiBev has identified issues that may arise from each stakeholder’s perspective, ranging from local communities, farmers, governments, to industrial estates. While measures are in place to tackle such issues, ThaiBev continues to have an inclusive dialogue on water resources management with ThaiBev’s stakeholders.

# ThaiBev’s Efforts to Protect Ecosystems

"... we need water to drink, for daily use, and for agriculture. Where there is water, we can survive. However, if there is no water, we will perish..."

— His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 17 March 1986

## ThaiBev’s Efforts to Protect Ecosystems

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of the water cycle in preserving natural ecosystems. ThaiBev joined forces with various partners to rehabilitate the watershed forests and restore natural water cycles to assist with beach forest preservation, and to save the oceans for marine wildlife protection and aquatic ecosystem revival, according to UN SDGs 14 and 15.

ThaiBev has assisted Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center, Doi Saket District, Chiang Mai Province in the rehabilitation of forests, raising awareness of environmental protection, fostering effective forest conservation, and enhancing the quality of life for people in Nan province. The objectives of the project are to study, research, and educate people on land and water conservation and to grow plants, rehabilitate the forests, and to build check dams. This project has succeeded in continuously replenishing water supplies.

Additionally, local people refrain from logging the forest as the project creates jobs and income for them. In 2016, 103 participants of the first-of-its-kind project had been provided with land and resources totaling to 3,000 baht each to raise baby frogs, Meishan pigs, Pradu Hangdam cocks, walking catfish, and Tilapia and to grow Bhutan oyster mushrooms. The yield’s value is about 2.5 times (or 7,500 baht). Also, this part-time job does not require intense physical labor and the yield is better than what would result from mono-cropping.


Another project in which ThaiBev is participating is "Joining Forces to Restore the Nature in commemoration of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn’s 60th birthday anniversary in 2015". The project’s objective is to revive the forest area at The Sirindhorn International Environmental Park, Rama VI camp, Cha-am district, Chonburi province. Its 17 rais of forest areas can be divided into two ecosystems for learning: mangrove and beach forests. Over 120 volunteers helped carry out the project by planting local trees that can endure a high salinity level, including Lour, Benth, Jack tree, Mahogany, Lam, and Mangrove to the area. For the past six years, the park has been developed to become a study center in ecology for the public. Moreover, ThaiBev has partnered with Administration Office 4 (Surat Thani), Tha Chang District, and Tha Poon Canal Conservation group to construct 5 fish habitats, and 1 sector (1 rai) of mangrove crab farm.

Over 80 volunteers have learnt about cockle farming and have assigned 60 tags to the trees in the mangrove forest area at Tha Poon Mor 1, Tambon Khao Tharn, Tha Chang district, Surat Thani province. The volunteers learned about the community’s way of life and participated in conservation activities which help enrich the sustainability of natural resources and the community. The project received warm support from the communities as well as local government agencies.

In addition, ThaiBev has cooperated with government agencies and fishing communities in the coastal areas to organize the “Majcha Street” project in order to restore the seawater quality and develop artificial coral reefs that provide a habitat for marine life. This is to revive the aquatic ecosystem of Khai Island in Pathio district, Chumphon province.

**ENERGY & CLIMATE CHANGE**


# Energy & Climate Change

**ThaiBev uses the SEP principle of Reasonableness to analyze various challenges and determine solutions that will reduce its impact on the environment and help alleviate the risk of climate change.**

Climate change is a global and international challenge that requires the cooperation of all sectors of society to mitigate its potentially dire consequences. As Thailand’s world-class total beverage producer and distributor, ThaiBev committed to being part of the world’s solutions to climate change. Among its missions are emission reduction and the efficient management of its carbon footprint.

There has been a warning echoed in the recent Conference of the Parties: COP 21 under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, about the effect of climate change on weather patterns, leading to severe droughts. The change in global weather patterns, as ThaiBev is fully aware, will affect its business, especially its procurement of raw materials and its production processes. Agricultural materials are crucial to production. Reduction of agricultural raw materials will result in rising prices, which will affect production costs.

To deal with these uncertainties, ThaiBev has adopted His Majesty King Bhumibol’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as the guiding principle for its corporate and business operations, to improve sustainability and self-reliance at every level with the SEP principles of “Reasonableness” and “Sufficiency” particularly in mind. To minimize climate-change impact, ThaiBev has been proactive and adamant in including all stakeholders in its campaign to tackle climate change.

ThaiBev also requires that its business partners follow its policy to practice sustainable agriculture. ThaiBev has integrated SEP into “the Company’s sustainable agriculture guideline”. ThaiBev aims to create a production process with the least environmental impact, not only for the present benefit but for future generations.

# Energy Consumption & Eco-Efficiency

### Notes:
- Energy consumption = the amount of fuel used × the estimated heating value of each fuel type.
- Conversion unit for energy and heat conversion is based on the same standard used by the Ministry of Energy, for calculating and referring to energy consumption rate for C1+, natural gas, coal and gasoline. Data and references are also obtained from ThaiBev regular operations.
- The total amount of energy consumption Intensity = the total amount of fuel consumption (non-renewable energy + renewable energy) + the total amount of electricity and steam purchased divided by production volume. Unit of measurement: megajoule per hectoliter of Finished Goods (MJ / hL FGs).

ThaiBev has implemented the system of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) for the maintenance of tools, machines, and equipment to save energy.


# Emission Reduction

ThaiBev has set its goal to reduce emission intensity from its production process. ThaiBev’s plan has been divided into two phases, with the ultimate goal to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 10% by 2020, in comparison with the base year 2014. The emission intensity reduction will be equivalent to 0.0152 metric tons CO₂e per hectoliter of finished goods (tCO₂e/hl FGs) (CO₂ emission). In year 2016, ThaiBev generated 0.01375 tCO₂e/hl FGs which is 12% lower than 2014. The successful reduction is the outcome of several campaigns it implemented to improve energy efficiency. ThaiBev produces biogas from distillery slop; the biogas produced helped cut down the amount of heavy fuel oil consumed. Furthermore, a solar energy project enables facilities to heat water without consuming fossil fuel energy. ThaiBev has also been able to produce electricity from excess biogas. Additionally, the Company launched a project to use treated wastewater effluent in agriculture, such as a campaign with palm oil plantations. ThaiBev also applies the 3Rs principle: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle with its packaging, and ensures fuel is used efficiently in logistics in order to reduce resource use and greenhouse gas emissions. ThaiBev succeeded in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1.4 million metric tons of CO₂e.

## 3Rs

- **Reduce**
  - 461 metric tons reduction of Polyethylene Terephthalate bottles (PET plastic bottle)
    - = reduced 1,329 tCO₂e
  - 10 micron thickness reduction of PET used in 126,252,192 PET labelings

- **Reuse**
  - 1,155,159,217 old bottles were reused in the production process
    - = reduced 1,401,892 tCO₂e

- **Recycle**
  - 21,615.12 metric tons cullet recycled to produce new bottles
    - = reduced 17,424 tCO₂e



# Reduction of CO₂ Emissions by Efficient Transportation

Thai Beverage Logistics Company Limited (TBL) provides logistic services for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. TBL provides warehousing, transportation, and distribution services to customers. TBL helps with the reduction of CO₂ emissions as it uses fuel sustainably to distribute products to customers. The Company has expanded to cover 68 warehouses. The two distributing centers and the transportation center under “4DX Trim-tab Certification” reached its goal in terms of “Delivery in Full on Time” index or DIFOT 100% of the time. The trucks used in transportation between provinces consumed less fuel from Jan – Sep of 2016. This is a result of efficient transportation that allowed the Company to save 171,335 liters of fuel, equivalent to 470 metric tons CO₂e.

In 2016, ThaiBev’s greenhouse gas emission intensities were lower than 2015. The reduction shows ThaiBev’s capability to increase production while working to reduce the Company’s burden on the environment.

### Notes:

- For 2016, ThaiBev has aligned its total energy consumption reporting period with that of its financial reporting. The period covers 9 months from January to September 2016 in which the Company has updated the data of greenhouse gas emission factors to be more accurate.
- ThaiBev Greenhouse Gas Emission table reports the following gases: carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). Calculating greenhouse gas emission intensity from used fuel (page 82) and refrigerant coolants is accomplished by measuring metric tons CO₂ per hectoliter of Finished Goods (tCO₂e / HL FGs). ThaiBev uses standards issued by the Carbon Footprint for Organisations (CFO) and guideline from Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) and additional references described in GWP source (the IPCC 4th Assessment Report).


# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report

## Commitment

### Effluents
ThaiBev treats its effluents to the highest standard and fully complies with laws and regulations.

### Waste
ThaiBev effectively manages its waste to ensure full compliance with laws and regulations.



**Effluents & Waste**



# Effluents & Waste

ThaiBev uses the SEP principle of Reasonableness to analyze various challenges and determine solutions that will reduce its impact on the environment and help alleviate the risk of climate change.

The food and beverages industry takes raw agricultural materials such as vegetables, fruits, cereal, and meat, and converts them into a variety of palatable foods and beverages that are convenient to consume and can be stored for long periods of time. But the process of preparing the raw materials – which can involve distilling, heating, freezing, and drying – requires high energy consumption and generates a large amount of waste in the form of wastewater, solid waste, food waste, and more. In addition, such foods and beverages can generate a large amount of packaging waste.

ThaiBev has committed to sustainably managing wastewater and solid waste from its production processes throughout the value chain. ThaiBev realizes such management practices can help mitigate not only ThaiBev’s environmental and social impacts, but also create value through increased efficiency in resource use and cost reductions. ThaiBev emphasizes creating value through waste innovation and management by collaborating with partners to innovate and develop new technology. ThaiBev’s ultimate goal is to minimize our impacts to the environment, which would represent a significantly sustainable value creation for ThaiBev’s business, for society, and for the environment.

## Effluent Management

ThaiBev strictly complies with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. ThaiBev has a wastewater treatment system to manage wastewater from its production processes that is tailor-designed to each individual facility. ThaiBev bi-annually reports the level of BOD, COD, pH, TSS, and TDS to the Department of Industrial Works via the Online Pollution Monitoring System. Additionally, all ThaiBev’s business units boast ISO 14001 certification, which covers the management of effluents and waste.

In 2016, a total of 26% of ThaiBev’s beverage production facilities discharged zero effluent to the environment. For the remaining 74% of facilities, the stringent treatment process ensures that the wastewater ThaiBev discharges meets or exceeds quality standards.


# Water Discharge by Quality in 2016

² Except for factories located in industrial estates. The plants have an initial treatment to meet the quality as specified by the particular industrial estate prior to the next treatment by the industrial estate.



## CASE STUDY: Creating Value from Vinasse

ThaiBev places great importance on the utilization of renewable energy. In ThaiBev’s alcohol distilleries, there is a large amount of vinasse – the wastewater from the distillation process. ThaiBev uses evaporation to concentrate the vinasse as well as reducing the odor. This concentrated vinasse is a suitable replacement for fuel oil in the incinerator/boiler system. This is a crucial part of ThaiBev waste-to-energy strategy and enables ThaiBev to produce 144,000 metric tons of steam per year.

ThaiBev is committed to further research and development on utilizing nutrients from wastewater effluent which is suitable for growing plants. This effluent can be used as soil conditioner, and has been distributed to farmers surrounding its facilities. Currently, farmers have utilized the effluent for planting sugarcane, tapioca, oil palm, and other crops, resulting in higher yields and increased profits from higher revenues and lower costs.

Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

## CASE STUDY: Solid Waste to Energy

ThaiBev continues its research and development efforts on recycling and converting waste from its production processes into energy. ThaiBev annually converts 0.4 metric tons of soot from boiler stacks, 30 metric tons of dried sludge, and 0.8 metric tons of scale from distillation columns into charcoal briquettes. Currently, the facilities that use coal as a source of energy can convert soot from boiler stacks to charcoal briquettes, which provide 3,650 kCal/kg heating value. If fully used, they would provide the equivalent of 6 gigajoules of energy. This provides ThaiBev with the alternative to use low-cost energy in its production processes, energy which can also be distributed to surrounding communities.

## CASE STUDY: By-Products to Animal Feed

ThaiBev has also established Feed Addition Co., Ltd. under the Thai Beverage Group with the aim to manage by-products from the facilities in the spirits and beer business groups. By-products such as wet malt residue, dried malt residue, and dry yeast are sold to feed mills or directly to livestock farmers, providing them with high quality raw materials that are chemical-free and have high nutritional value. In addition, by-products such as settled solid, vinasse ash, and other sludge, which have high nutrients for plants, are sold as raw materials to fertilizer manufacturing facilities.

## CASE STUDY: By-Products to Agricultural

Feed Addition Co., Ltd., in cooperation with Kasetsart University, also carries out research and development on the use of by-products from distilleries and breweries to produce soil supplements containing organic matter and high nutrients which are suitable for organic farming. ThaiBev started the experiment in a sugarcane demonstration plot, and has distributed the soil supplements to farmers who work near ThaiBev’s facilities to use in organic farming.

## Post-consumption Packaging Management

Apart from ThaiBev’s commitment to reducing plastic in its packaging, ThaiBev also focuses on integrated post-consumption packaging management, especially for plastic bottles and aluminum cans, through partnerships with packaging recycling companies. ThaiBev has also established Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd. to buy back and recycle glass bottles, scrap glass, paper briquettes, and corrugated box partitions. ThaiBev currently recycles more than 40 thousand metric tons of these materials.

In addition, ThaiBev also partners with companies with plastic weaving technology to recycle plastic from packaging into clothes, bulletproof vests, and auto parts.

# Food Waste Management

ThaiBev has committed to reducing food waste through efficiency management throughout the value chain. ThaiBev emphasizes the monitoring of food waste from the production process and the improvement of its processes and machinery, especially in ThaiBev’s food production process at Oishi Central Kitchen, the main producer of food products for Oishi restaurants and retail distribution.

With the latest technology to reduce food loss from the food production process and a commitment to the “Circular Economy” concept, ThaiBev manages food waste from the production process and supplies to the subsidiary companies to process as animal feed. This process enables ThaiBev to reach its goal to continuously reduce food waste disposed of as general waste.

In 2016, ThaiBev sold 1,086 metric tons of food waste to its subsidiaries to process as animal feed, consisting of bread waste (crust and scrap), and fish scrap (bone, head, tail, guts), through which ThaiBev is able to reduce waste to landfill (including both food waste – vegetable and wanton wrapper scraps, and general waste) to only 3% of total food production volume from Oishi Central Kitchen. In addition, the added value products from food waste resulted in revenue generation for ThaiBev of 4 million baht per year approximately.

## Social and Community Development

Following the principles of SEP and the example set by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, ThaiBev is dedicated to helping develop communities in a sustainable and sensitive way. This means first learning about each specific community by engaging with the residents directly and then aiming to let the community manage itself. Meanwhile, ThaiBev offers assistance where help is truly needed, such as through strategic, logistical, or monetary support. Truly collaborative community development efforts are more likely to succeed and provide a sustainable model applicable to other sectors.

ThaiBev prioritizes establishing good working relationships with communities, leading to the sustainable development of both communities and businesses. The Company’s focus is on participation and the contribution of ideas, and bringing diverse projects to the developing community. ThaiBev also aims to better understand how to improve cooperation between communities and factories, and how to project a positive and sustainable image to the surrounding community.

ThaiBev has set out the criteria for undertaking initiatives by dividing target communities into two groups:

- **Communities in the vicinity of the factory** – to uphold high standards of business practice, the Company believes the active promotion of the community, development and sustainability are all interlinked.

- **Communities with the potential to be model communities** – with strong community leaders, a philanthropic outlook, a cooperative spirit, and a network, benefits can be extended to other communities.

# ThaiBev Initiative to Create Better Occupations

## 1 Tambon 1 Role Model Initiative for the Sustainable Community Development

ThaiBev is committed to finding ways to help districts support and strengthen one another. This includes the development of sustainable business practices alongside the sustainable development of the country. The Company hopes that the creation of the following initiatives will lead to the strengthening of these communities’ networks and partnerships as well as their businesses and economies. Together with the Occupational Foundation, ThaiBev has developed the Initiative to Create Better Occupations (1 Tambon 1 Role Model Initiative), with the main goal of developing the community’s economy, reducing its expenses, and increasing income without any negative impacts on oneself, others, and the environment. As a result of these commitments, ThaiBev’s initiatives have created collaboration within communities, established the proven method known as the Five-Forces Model (Pracharath), and developed working forums, or task forces, for bi-lateral parties within communities. Each task force comprises a community leader and a bi-lateral party of local government and private sector leaders, and includes a collaboration to survey and develop a database on community economies to analyze and create co-learning and to develop district development plans accordingly.

In 2016, ThaiBev implemented the Better Occupations Initiative with central partners and local associate partners in the three districts of Bua Yai in Nan province, Pone Thong in Chaiyabhum province, and Khaotran in Surat Thani province. The results were as follows:

![Kao Mee Soob Organic Sprouted Brown Rice, a product from the 1 Tambon 1 Role Model Initiative project. The value-added brown rice was developed for food-processing workgroups in Pone Thong district.](image.jpg)



# CASE STUDY 1
**Bua Yai, Nan province**

In Bua Yai, several problems were recognized. Chemically intensive agriculture was combined with poor water management on highland farms, plantations that encroached on forests, shifting cultivation practices, and a risk of villagers developing cancer. To help address these issues, a collaborative effort—the Bua Yai Model—was initiated to "manage water through integrated agriculture and continue expanding the 1 Rai Kaset Insri organic-farming concept with the goal of restoring the forests in Nan province".

## Important Goals

- **To restore the forest** to increase ecological diversity, forest cover and water supply.
- **To adapt the monoculture agricultural model** to integrated farming with the 1 Rai Kaset Insri model (Organic Farming).
- **To promote economic foundations** to generate income and secure a food source for the community.

## Results in 2016

- **To restore the forest:**
  - Added 541 rai of forest area and increased the number of trees planted by 10,583.
  - Established water-management systems and 9 hydraulic ram pumps to send water from lowlands to highlands. This helped farmers who previously lacked water to be able to farm in 3 areas.

- **To adapt the agricultural model:**
  - Developed the 1 Rai Kaset Insri organic-farming project, which now involves 302 participating farming households and 50 farms.

- **To promote economic foundations:**
  - Increased the average income of farmers who previously made 5,000 baht per rai by planting corn to 30,000 baht per rai by selling pumpkins (9,600 kilograms)—a sixfold income increase. The average farming household income also increased 167% per month in Nan province, which in 2015 earned an average income of 17,886 baht per month.

**Note:** A hydraulic ram pump is used to push water from lower levels to higher levels, and functions by using water and air pressure.

> "Community leaders and community members recognized the sincerity of the Company and changed their perspectives. They appreciated that the Company conducted field visits to co-develop strategies with them without imposing ideas on the local residents, and also allowing locals to think for themselves and growing from within."

**Thikamporn Kongsorn**  
President of Kaset Insri Enterprise Bua Yai, Nan province


# CASE STUDY 2
**Pone Thong, Chaiyaphum province**

In Pone Thong, several problems were recognized. ThaiBev discovered that the community had the potential and knowledge to process rice, but could not produce enough to meet the market demand. At the same time, they also lacked a diverse supply outlet, packaging standards, and effective community management. In addition, health issues arose from overuse of chemicals in agriculture. The Company’s work resulted in the Pone Thong Model of “creating a district economy by using organic rice fields and farming, and reducing harm to oneself, others, and the environment.”

## Important Goals

- To reduce the costs of rice and vegetable farming through cost-effective organic farming.
- To open up new market avenues.
- To promote professionalism and strengthen the community’s learning capacity and production.

### Results in 2016

- **To reduce the costs of rice and vegetable farming through cost-effective organic farming.**
  - Made a plan to reduce the cost of growing rice and vegetables by instituting organic farming.
  - Used a System of Rice Intensification (SRI), making organic vegetable patches without the use of chemicals, reducing costs by producing organic fertilizer to be distributed and shared in the district.
  - The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) used by 20 farming households across 20 rai (Riceberry Rice) resulted in doubling the usual yield (1 ricefield usually makes 400 kilograms; here 800 kilograms were harvested).

- **To open up new market avenues.**
  - New marketing channels were launched, with 3 associate partners buying more than 6,800 kilograms of rice.

- **To promote professionalism and strengthen the community’s learning capacity and production.**
  - Combined occupational groups consist of the Organic Brown Rice Group, Drinking Water Group, Textile Group, and Organic Vegetable Group. This was a change from the previous individualization of work.
  - The Organic Brown Rice Product was selected to be a community five-star product in 2016. Producing 800 – 1,000 kilograms more rice per rai (field), community incomes were increased by 6,000 – 10,000 baht per rai.
  - Established a center for learning about organic rice and organic farming (the Smart Farmer Centre in Chaiyaphum province).

**Note:** The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a method of rice farming that aims to increase potential rice yields while using fewer seeds and half the water usually needed. The amount of rice produced by this method is at least equal to traditional rice-planting methods but usually results in larger yields.

“Previously, villagers would just continue doing what they had always known, using the same old systems. When the Company said they would come in, we started wondering, what were they going to do? They might not be good – after all, companies are always looking out for their own interests. We wondered, what will they use us for? All the villagers were talking, and none of us could sleep, but in the end we decided to try it once. And when they came, they stayed with us. They invited us to think but allowed us to make the decisions, so that we finally understood they weren’t out to get us. Even if we made decisions that led to problems, they would come and help, and let organizations know, and bring innovations and new market avenues to help us reach the point where we felt confident they were really here to help and not to take advantage of us.”

**Nanta Pajitnee**  
Smart Farmer 2016 and President of Organic Brown Rice Processing, Pone Thong, Chaiyaphum province

# CASE STUDY 3
**Khaotarn, Surat Thani province**

In Khaotarn, ThaiBev helped develop a working model for the conservation of existing local skills and resources. This included high-quality local herbs, the way of life in the community, and the abundant natural resources found in the mountains, forests, rice fields, and the ocean. The goal was to create an integrated community economy through observation of community and eco-tourism.

## Important Goals

- **Continued development of community events under the district strategic plan.**
  - Created a work system that involved all activities and reflected the potential of the community.
  - Appointed a district-tourism committee in Khaotarn with 14 members from 3 groups: the Herb Processing Group, the Conservation Group, and the Homestay Group.
  - Designed and outlined a tourism route, and established appropriate prices.

- **To expand knowledge and combine local resources.**
  - Developed 8 homes suitable for homestay visits.
  - Developed the conservation of coastal fisheries. Ten fish houses were created to increase available resources.
  - Constructed an herb house; developed packaging, marketing, and PR.

- **To expand the network of Surat City of Herbs.**
  - Selected a product from the Herb Processing Group to be the five-star community product of 2016.
  - Formed more than 20 groups in Surat Thani province, according to government policy.
  - Encouraged the Herb Processing Group to become a center for learning in Khaotarn.

### Results in 2016

- Created a work system that involved all activities and reflected the potential of the community.
- Appointed a district-tourism committee in Khaotarn with 14 members from 3 groups: the Herb Processing Group, the Conservation Group, and the Homestay Group.
- Designed and outlined a tourism route, and established appropriate prices.
- Developed 8 homes suitable for homestay visits.
- Developed the conservation of coastal fisheries. Ten fish houses were created to increase available resources.
- Constructed an herb house; developed packaging, marketing, and PR.
- Selected a product from the Herb Processing Group to be the five-star community product of 2016.
- Formed more than 20 groups in Surat Thani province, according to government policy.
- Encouraged the Herb Processing Group to become a center for learning in Khaotarn.



"I'm proud. Even though they are a large company, they still came to help the community. They didn’t give us money; they taught us and sent smart people to help us. Today we still tell visitors that ThaiBev has helped us. Now many organizations admire them. Before, they thought ThaiBev just gave away blankets."

# The Model Youth in the Bangkuwat Community Initiative

ThaiBev and the Kenan Institute Asia initiated the Youth Community Initiative in Bangkuwat, a three-year initiative in the area surrounding the factory of Sura Bangyikhan Company Limited. The initiative develops youth role models for the community by enrolling them in a youth camp where they learn project-management skills for their community. Before entering the youth camp, they envision and develop ideas for a better society. By integrating this with school lessons on a weekly basis, they have the opportunity to exchange their knowledge and prepare for leadership roles in the community. Those who pass this program will be recognized as young initiators who have undergone real-life experience (also known as project-based learning).

In 2016, 71 young initiators were involved in 12 projects under the Navigating a Better Quality of Life Initiative for promoting health, sufficiency farming, drug prevention, and entrepreneurship. Currently, youth from 12 recognized projects are organizing more than 40 activities across 12 villages. This proven power of youth has transformed communication within these communities and created a new drive for higher standards of living.

![Youth Initiative Image](image.jpg)

“It’s a good project, and develops our children to have a better conscience to do good deeds, to volunteer and collaborate with the community. This results in a stronger and sustainable nation. This project has been a great way to develop valuable human resources for our community, families and society, so new generations will live happily and sustainably.”

# ThaiBev's Unite to Fight the Cold Initiative

*"17 years of ThaiBev creating sustainable societies"*

Climate change has led to intense and unpredictable weather across all regions of Thailand, threatening the well-being of vulnerable communities. New waves of sudden and severe cold weather are causing difficulties for some residents who do not have sufficient funds to keep warm and who are not accustomed to living in the cold.

In response, ThaiBev created the 'Unite to Fight the Cold' Initiative to provide those in need with high-quality blankets. Special emphasis was placed on the North and Northeast areas of Thailand, which have suffered continuous cold weather and are populated by four vulnerable or at-risk groups: the elderly, children without future caregivers, people with low incomes, and people experiencing hardship.

ThaiBev has worked together with the Ministry of Interior, which has helped define the locations of these victims in the North and Northeast, and continues to do so annually. Each year, 200,000 blankets are donated across 15 target provinces. Over the past 17 years, 3,400,000 blankets have been donated across 45 provinces and 578 districts. Data analysis also helps prevent the duplication of recipients. In 2016 alone, 11,019,566 people needed 2,375,490 blankets to protect them from the cold.

ThaiBev has partnered with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (Ministry of Interior) to deliver warmth to each province. The project has also received support from both the public and private sectors to help deliver blankets. ThaiBev's employees and others with kind hearts participated in the program in 2016 by donating an additional 1,000 blankets to be distributed in Saraburi province, making this the 16th province to be assisted in addition to the targeted 15.

| **3,400,000** blankets have been donated in the past 17 years. |

# Sustainability Report  
Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

The number of Thais who work in the agricultural sector totals approximately 25 million. Each farming household earns an average income of 50,000 baht per year, which is well below the average living wage of 100,000 baht per household per year. This is a national problem that should be solved collectively through the five sectors:

1. **Public Sector** – Implement policies to create infrastructure and provide support via funding from financial and lending institutions.
2. **Private Sector** – Help teach management strategies, create marketing networks, provide business planning, and receive funding through banks and the Pi Chuay Nong Project.
3. **Academic Sector** – Provide know-how from research, and develop manufacturing technology and knowledge on agriculture and processing.

# Sarn Palung Pua Baan Gert Project to Create Community Business Developers

Training was scheduled between September and December 2016 so all 76 provinces could begin working simultaneously in January 2017. There were a total of 69 participants, with training areas in 5 provinces:

- **Phuket**: 14 people
- **Petchaburi**: 19 people
- **Buriram**: 10 people
- **Chiang Mai**: 16 people
- **Udon Thani**: 10 people


# Agriculture

## The Longkong of the South Initiative (Narathiwat and Pattani Provinces)

The Ministry of Interior, together with the Public-Private Steering Committee, the Royal Initiative Discovery Foundation, the Royal Lives Development Foundation, and leading modern trade entrepreneurs in Thailand, has distributed 3,244 metric tons of longkong under this initiative. The fruits were bought at 6-30 baht per kilogram, which is above the market price of 5 baht per kilogram. To lay the foundation for sustained long-term development, vacuum packaging was developed to extend life and a product separation standard was implemented. Farmers’ skills were developed, together with training on making longkong ice-cream and juice as pilot products to test the market response.

## Pracharath Samakki (Chiang Mai) Co., Ltd.

Longan farmers from Kuamoong village in Sarapee district were assisted in finding new distribution channels to cut out middlemen and sell directly to buyers. This increased earnings from 18 baht to 38 baht per kilogram.

Additionally, the Committee also helped support the Phuket Lobster event from 1-31 August 2016. Pracharath Rak Samakkhi (Phuket) Co., Ltd. created a campaign to market the renowned local Phuket Lobster, also known as the Painted Spiny Lobster, which was once famous to tourists from all over the world. The hope and aim of this initiative is to help generate income for local communities breeding spiny lobsters. The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has estimated income flows of 100 million baht from this initiative.

# Processors

## Thai Loincloth (Pa Kaw Mar) Thai Crafts Initiative

Select loincloths (Pa Kaw Mar) with distinct patterns and a clear background story were made into new products designed by leading designers, which added value to the products made by the community. This can be considered a way to conserve Thai culture; it supports and teaches the community to turn raw natural materials into uniquely patterned loincloths. Every province’s loincloth has a distinctive character that could be registered and trademarked, leading to increased distribution in both Thailand and abroad.

## The Household Rice Miller Initiative

This initiative allows villagers to mill their own rice to their desired quantity and time. This also creates new distribution channels where farmers can sell rice directly to consumers at a higher price and establish direct relationships with buyers. Consumers could also choose from different types of rice species, from different areas, and mill it themselves.

## Batik Design Week

This event took place between 24-28 September 2016 in Phuket, hosted by Pracharath Rak Samakkhi (Phuket) Co., Ltd., and in 5 provinces on the Andaman Coast and 5 southern-border provinces, hosted by the Community Development Department. Total sales exceeded 2 million baht, and more orders are being placed regularly.


# Community-led Tourism

## Tourism led by Tham Rong Community in Phetchaburi Province

This project is located at Uncle Thanom’s palm sugar plantation. Employing villagers as facilitators at each visiting station, the project has increased their income by 500 baht. More products from the community were sold, such as products from Dongyang Market in Ban Lard district, Phetchaburi province. This resulted in an increase of monthly community-wide incomes from 6,000 baht to 48,000 baht per community. A collaboration with Phetchaburi Rajabhat University to study and design assistive equipment for palm collectors is also helping to create more efficient harvesting.

## Baan Sanuan Nok, Buriram Province

This creative community-based tourism project is listed by the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). Representatives from the Chinese Government and Mongolian Ministry of Culture visited the community from 27-28 August 2016. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports and TAT also organized a media tour to promote the area.

# Education

## A Continually Learning Society Leads to Sustainable Development

ThaiBev is committed to building a continuously learning society through a variety of different project initiatives within organizations, communities, and educational institutions. This is in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to create quality education.

ThaiBev not only strives to be a leading company in the production of innovative beverages – it also aims to be a productive part of society by developing one of the most basic but important factors of life: human capital. Through this, ThaiBev aims to develop knowledge and enhance ability by beginning with employees’ children, allowing them to establish a strong educational foundation and grow to be important forces in society.

ThaiBev initiated The Educational Scholarships for Children of Employees in 2010 to support employees’ children with good academic performance. This helps lighten the burden of expenses shouldered by parents. The Company schedules two timeframes for scholarship considerations. The first timeframe is for scholarships for elementary school studies up to the vocational–diploma level, and was due this year in August 2016; the second is for higher education and special-case scholarships (The White Elephant Scholarship), which was considered and granted this year in October 2016.

Between 2010–2016, there were 114 general scholarship recipients. Two children of ThaiBev employees were also awarded special case scholarships (The White Elephant Scholarship), and 17 of the general scholarship awardees were also invited to work for the Company.

# The Princess Galyani Vadhana Teacher Award

The Princess Galyani Vadhana Teacher Award was initiated by HRH Princess Srinagarindra and HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana to recognize the sacrifices made by teachers in remote areas. They are invaluable role models for youth development. The organization selected outstanding teachers from three institutes: the Border Patrol Police, the Office of the Non-Formal and Informal Education (ONIE), and the Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC).

These were teachers who have worked hard and made sacrifices in remote areas in 17 provinces in the North, three provinces along the Southern borders, and in Kanchanaburi province. The Princess Galyani Vadhana Teacher Award aims to give these teachers who work responsibly in remote areas morale and a sense of honor for their contributions to the community. It is also a way to publish and announce their good deeds, bestowing virtue on the teachers who serve as role models to other teachers, students, and general society.

Currently, three teachers are selected from each aforementioned institution. Awards have been granted 8 times for a total of 69 distinguished teachers. In 2016, prizes totalling 1,000,000 baht were awarded.

**Notes:**

1. In 2016, ThaiBev has aligned its energy consumption (megajoules), water withdrawal (cubic meter), reused water and recycle water (cubic meter), direct emissions (metric tons CO₂e), indirect emissions (metric tons CO₂e) and water discharge (cubic meter) reporting period with that of its financial reporting. The period covers 9 months from January to September 2016. All previous years data are for a 12 month period so cannot be compared on a like for like basis.
2. Data for 2013-2015 has been updated from the figures disclosed in the 2015 Sustainability Report as ThaiBev has updated the factors for energy and emission to the current value.
3. Waste disposal is classified by types of waste from the manufacturing process, consisting of the following 4 types:
   3.1 General waste – disposed of by local authorities, such as the municipality or sub-district Administrative organization
   3.2 Hazardous waste – disposed of by legally licensed companies
   3.3 By-product waste – handled by Feed Addition Co.,Ltd., one of ThaiBev’s subsidiary companies, to generate income for the company
   3.4 Valuable waste – sorted so that it can be reused and recycled
4. ¹ThaiBev has corrected the 2014 figures for total weight of waste and valuable waste.

# Independent Limited Assurance Report

## Independent Assurance Statement to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) was engaged by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev) to provide limited assurance in relation to specified 2016 disclosures in the ThaiBev Sustainability Report 2016 ('the Report') as set out below.

### Engagement Summary

#### Scope of our assurance engagement

Whether the following disclosures for reporting year 2016 are fairly presented, in all material respects, with the reporting criteria:

1. Sections on stakeholder engagement and materiality (including GRI G4-17 to G4-27)
2. General G4 disclosure:
   - G4-34 (Governance)
3. Specific G4 disclosures:
   - Economic: G4-EC1* (Consistency of financial data with audited accounts)
   - Environmental: G4-EN3 (Total Energy Consumption in MJ), G4-EN8 (Total Water Withdrawal by source in m³), G4-EN10 (Water recycled and reused in % and m³ respectively) G4-EN15 (GHG Scope 1 in metric tons CO2e), G4-EN16 (GHG Scope 2 in metric tons CO2e), G4-EN22 (Total Water discharge by destination in m³)
   - Social: G4-LA9, G4-LA11, G4-SO1
4. Intensity indicators
   - Water withdrawal (l/L / hL FGs)
   - Energy consumption (MJ / hL FGs)
   - GHG emissions (Scope 1+2 in metric tons CO2e / hL FGs)

#### Reporting Criteria

The GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and ThaiBev’s own internal reporting requirements.

#### Assurance Standard

ERM CVS’ assurance methodology, based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised).

#### Assurance Level

Limited assurance.

#### Respective Responsibilities

- **ThaiBev** is responsible for preparing the data and for its correct presentation in reporting to third parties, including disclosure of the reporting criteria and boundary.
- **ERM CVS**’ responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the assurance activities performed and exercising our professional judgement.

### Our Conclusions

Based on our activities, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the disclosures for reporting year 2016, as listed above, are not fairly presented, in all material respects, with the reporting criteria.

### Our Assurance Activities

Our objective was to assess whether the selected disclosures are reported in accordance with the principles of completeness, comparability (across the organisation) and accuracy (including calculations, use of appropriate conversion factors and consolidation). We planned and performed our work to obtain all the information and explanations that we believe were necessary to provide a basis for our assurance conclusions.

A multi-disciplinary team of EHS and assurance specialists performed the following activities:

- Interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the data management systems and processes (including IT systems and internal review processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected data;
- A review of the internal indicator definitions and conversion factors;
- Visits to four sites in Thailand: Beer Thai (1991) – Brewery, Sura Bangyikhan – Distillery, Fuengfuanant – Distillery and Sermsuk (Prathumthani) – Non-alcoholic plant to review local reporting processes and consistency of reported annual data with selected underlying source data for each indicator. We interviewed relevant staff, reviewed site data capture and reporting methods, checked calculations and assessed the local internal quality and assurance processes.
- An analytical review of the data from all sites and a check on the completeness and accuracy of the data consolidation for the selected G4 disclosures at corporate level.
- Assurance activities at ThaiBev’s head office in Bangkok including interviews with responsible staff and document review covering the results of internal data review procedures, and a review of stakeholder engagement, materiality determination processes and sustainability governance in the reporting year.

### Limitations

The reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this context. We note that the boundary for the report, as described in the section ‘About our Sustainability Report 2016’ is limited to ThaiBev and its subsidiaries in Thailand. This statement was provided to ThaiBev in English and applies to the English version of the Report. Our responsibilities do not extend to translations.

# Our Observations

We have provided ThaiBev with Management Report with our findings and recommendations. Without affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the following key observation:

- Recognising that ThaiBev is in a phase of growth ThaiBev should consider including the sustainability activities and performance of its International Businesses more fully in future Reports.
