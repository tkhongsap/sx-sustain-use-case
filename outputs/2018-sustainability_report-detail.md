2018 was a significant year for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (“ThaiBev”). As we marked our 15th anniversary, ThaiBev was recognized as a member of Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the World Index family and Emerging Markets Index family. We achieved the highest sustainability scores on a global scale and were recognized as an industry leader, reflecting our progress towards fulfilling our goal of becoming a stable and sustainable leader in ASEAN and the world’s leading beverage company.

Led by our “Vision 2020”, which emphasizes the five pillars of Growth, Diversity, Brands, Reach and Professionalism, in 2018 ThaiBev also pushed ahead with its expansion in ASEAN. Two landmark moments – our acquisition of Saigon Beer – Alcohol – Beverage Corporation (Sabeco) in Vietnam and Grand Royal Group in Myanmar – will help us achieve our Vision 2020 objectives. Over the last 15 years, ThaiBev has grown to become a true ASEAN company with a wide range of products in our portfolio, diverse and professional working teams, and extensive reach throughout the ASEAN region.

This progress comes with significant and growing responsibilities. As ThaiBev moves forward, we must constantly monitor and assess our risks and impacts in order to create truly sustainable growth for the region. We must stay abreast of social and technological changes, and consider the environmental footprint of our supply chain. As our workforce grows, and our operations cross new borders, we must meet the new challenges by maintaining our values and respecting the rights of all.

At the heart of our commitment to all the communities in which we operate is our ongoing dedication to “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth.” This means ThaiBev will not only pursue growth in the name of financial bottom line, but also to promote quality of life in community, the health of the environment and the happiness of the people. For the past several years, since we established our Corporate Sustainability Development Committee, we have further instilled the sustainability ethos in the management and among the workforce, and each year, as evidenced by our improving DJSI scores, we are achieving a deeper understanding and more effective implementation by embedding sustainability practices throughout our human capital, value chain and business practices.

In Thailand, our commitment to sustainability has been highlighted not only by our internal dedication to reduce our footprint and protect the health of our workers and consumers, but also by our extensive outreach to communities through the Pracharath Rak Samakkee social enterprises initiative. This social enterprise network focuses on income-generating in the areas of agriculture, value-added products and community-based tourism. ThaiBev facilitates improvements in five areas – access to factors of production, innovations, marketing, communication and creating awareness of sustainability and management. All of our activities continue to be guided by the principles of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanathbobitra’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Also relevant to our commitment to a prosperous ASEAN is our work together with C asean, an institution which is focused on supporting start-ups, fostering connectivity, and strengthening competitiveness among all ASEAN countries. ThaiBev is inspired to preserve and showcase the unique cultural attributes of Thailand and ASEAN.

As we completed 15 years of successful operations, it is clear that great opportunities lie ahead. ThaiBev’s determination to be an ASEAN business leader remains as strong as ever. Our goal is to not only maintain strong growth but to benefit all of our stakeholders and contribute to the overall social and environmental progress of the region.

# ThaiBev Board Commitment

The ThaiBev Board (the “Board”) is committed to improving the sustainability of the ThaiBev Group (the “Group”). Sustainability considerations, including environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) issues, the natural resources management, the development of human capital, organization, and corporate culture, are integral and essential matters which we take into account in our formulation of the overall strategy for the Group. We fully support all efforts by ThaiBev’s management team in this area.

Furthermore, as the Group’s long-term sustainability is a key priority for the Board and as efforts in this respect depend on the management team’s implementation and operational abilities, the Board has made it clear that our evaluation of their performance takes into account their effectiveness in delivering on the commitments made to sustainability initiatives and targets in this report.

The Board is committed to being transparent, clear and open about ThaiBev’s businesses to its shareholders and other stakeholders. The disclosures made in this report and in the Group’s annual report are in line with this commitment. In this report, we have discussed ThaiBev’s efforts to continue building on and strengthening the Group’s collaboration with business partners to drive positive economic, environmental, and social impact throughout its value chain with good governance.

The Board has assigned responsibility for overseeing ThaiBev’s sustainability initiatives and the preparation of this sustainability report to the Group’s Corporate Sustainability Development Committee (“Committee”) and working team. The Board receives regular reports and presentations from the Committee and the ThaiBev management team on their sustainability objectives, targets, initiatives, challenges, progress and achievements, as well as the management and emphasizing of the material factors relating to ESG, natural resources management (e.g. water resources), human capital and corporate culture development of relevance to the Group.

In 2017, the Board extended the scope of the Risk Management Committee to govern the Group’s sustainable development strategies and renamed the committee to the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee. This change allowed the Group to effectively integrate its risk assessment and management with the Group’s sustainable development strategies and initiatives. The committee addressed key material topics from climate change to water stewardship to consumer health and safety, marking ThaiBev as an early mover in combining these processes. The Group has also planned to expand its sustainable development goals to cover overseas operations, allowing us to become a truly sustainable and stable total beverage leader in ASEAN.



```
For 15 years, ThaiBev has aimed to create and share the value from its continuous growth. ThaiBev is committed to meeting consumer needs, which have been changing with every generation and period, and for different gender and age groups, and is dedicated to bring happiness to every moment of your life through quality beverages. ThaiBev also conducts its business in accordance with a sustainability approach by taking society and the environment into consideration, as well as good business performance. This enables ThaiBev and all of its stakeholders to grow sustainably in all aspects and prepares ThaiBev to become a stable and sustainable total beverage leader in the ASEAN market.

“ThaiBev... Always with You”

# THAIBEV'S VALUE CHAIN

For ThaiBev, development of the Value Chain is an important strategy to deliver business success. To enhance confidence in the production of quality products and sustainable growth, the company pays attention to every procedure and process in the Value Chain as follows:

## Sourcing

As a leading national beverage producer, the sourcing process must be efficient, transparent and committed to achieving results that maintain the quality of products and services, by considering the following factors:

- Giving priority to developing the potential business partners or suppliers to achieve goals and mutual sustainable growth with the company. A code of practice for suppliers has been established, and risk management mechanisms have been put in place for products and services, together with managing and assessing performance to make sure that they meet appropriate standards and management processes.
- Sourcing processes to standards that consider environmental and social factors such as water management, occupational health and safety, as well as providing oversight to ensure that quality and safe products and services will reach consumers.
- Considering the impact of post-consumption such as using bioPET bottles for Chang Mineral Water, which is made from 30 percent plant-based materials.

## Production

ThaiBev gives priority to every stage of production, including:

- Controlling the quality of products to be correct in line with legal requirements and various international management standards covering the environment, safety, and consumer health, such ISO 9001, GMP, HACCP, ISO 14001, and the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) drinking water standard.
- Production safety, which involves good hygiene management, only choosing quality raw materials which are safe and bring about the highest consumer satisfaction.
- Using various resources such as water and energy to get the greatest value and bring the most benefits without creating pollution. Alternative energy sources are used, such as steam for distilleries, anaerobic waste treatment systems installation, as well as once through boilers, while various innovations and technology continue to be developed.


# Distribution

With an efficient product distribution process, alongside strong distribution channels that span across Thailand, ThaiBev is able to:

- Maintain and deliver the highest quality products to all customers; while maintaining good relationships with business partners, as well as meet the needs of distributors with professional levels of services.
- Use modern technology in managing and planning product distribution and transportation systems, such as ensuring driving discipline so that it is safe for drivers, and efficiently manage the use of fuel.
- Expand logistics services to customers in the restaurant segment in Thailand. Last year, the company took a shareholding in HAVI Logistics (Thailand) Co., Ltd., an expert in Cold Chain temperature-controlled transportation.

# Marketing and Sales

ThaiBev delivers products to consumers through efficient distribution channels by:

- Creating a strong network and building good relationships with customers through a variety of projects such as The Agent "Next Gen" and marketing activities in its distribution channels, which is a strategy for efficient growth according to Vision 2020.
- Communicating and publicizing responsibility to consumers and society through the "Serve Responsibly" project and holding sales promotions that create good relationships with consumers, as well as listening to consumers' opinions through various communications channels, which are then used to develop and respond to customers' needs as much as possible.

# Post-consumption Packaging Management

ThaiBev believes that good packaging should not only protect the product and make it look pleasing, but should also be reusable, so the company aims to:

- Reuse packaging materials such as corrugated cartons and carton box partitions, glass bottles, aluminum cans and plastic crates in the manufacturing process.
- Develop packaging from materials which can be reused and recycled in the manufacturing process to reduce post-consumption waste, as "single-use" packaging creates too much trash and wastes natural resources in the manufacturing of these materials.

# SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

ThaiBev embraces King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), in tandem with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), to establish its sustainable development strategy. These principles are incorporated into guidelines to push forward business operations in a responsible manner for society and all stakeholders.

Business operations should be founded on the basis of the middle path as exemplified in the three major parts of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, which are:

- **Moderation**
- **Reasonableness**
- **Prudence**

### Moderation
- Work following one’s abilities and potential
- Avoid extremes
- Exercise financial discipline

### Reasonableness
- Assess the reasons for every action affecting stakeholders
- Create real, authentic value

### Prudence
- Manage risk
- Prepare for future impacts or changes

The conditions for these three principles to arise are the use of Knowledge and Virtues.

### Knowledge
- In-depth information
- Correct understanding
- The linking together of knowledge and experience

### Virtues
- Integrity
- Sincerity
- Diligence
- Self-awareness
- Humility

# The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy

The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy consists of three principles: Moderation, Reasonableness, and Prudence. Abiding by these three principles, based on the foundations of knowledge and virtue, allows the company to remain stable and sustainable through the currents of globalization and change, leading to balanced progress in all four dimensions: Economy, Society, Environment, and Culture. At the same time, with its sustainable development strategy, ThaiBev is confident that it will be able to be self-sustaining and develop limitless opportunities for the business and society as a whole.

The two frameworks, SEP and UN SDGs, emphasize utilizing knowledge, experience, and rationale to achieve steady growth, while reducing environmental impacts and promoting human capital development. Moreover, SEP and UN SDGs are consistent with ThaiBev’s Vision 2020 to become a stable and sustainable Asean leader. Hence, ThaiBev prioritizes engaging and establishing good relationships with all stakeholders so that sustainable growth can be attained for all.

## Dimensions

- **Economy**: Creating business value
- **Society**: Caring and sharing
- **Environment**: Managing impacts from business
- **Culture**: Promoting artistic and cultural conservation

# Inputs from Stakeholders

In 2018, ThaiBev carried out an annual sustainability survey, consulting all eight stakeholder groups. A third-party expert was tasked with conducting interviews and sending surveys to a sample group of stakeholders. The results from the stakeholder engagement process were used to assess key issues in corporate sustainability development.

## Insights from Sustainability Experts

**M.L. Dispanadda Diskul**  
Chief Executive Officer, Mae Fah Luang Foundation

"When a company decides to give something back to society, it should be done in a way that is consistent with the company's established expertise and experience. For instance, an agribusiness company should allocate its personnel and laboratories to help improve the quality of agricultural products, educating farmers on how to reduce toxins in the soil, and conduct integrated farming. They could also advise on new techniques that farmers can utilize to develop and improve their produce. This could generate more income and bring about sustainability to the community. A beverage company, for instance, could use its know-how to help improve water quality, and in return utilize those water resources in the manufacturing process to produce products with even higher quality, while also contributing to the improvement of natural resources and healthier communities.

ThaiBev, as a large private company, has always played a major role in society. And its leading role in sustainable development has recently been proven after being named the beverage industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI). This recognition is a demonstration of the far-reaching vision of the company’s executives as well as the dedication and efforts of its staff. So I hope that ThaiBev will be able to drive changes while also encouraging other companies to take responsibility and pay more attention to sustainable development."



# Insights from Sustainability Experts

## Brendan Edgerton
**Director, Circular Economy**  
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)

"The WBCSD brings together leading companies to share best practices and collaborate to create a world in which 9 billion people live well within the means of the planet. This collaborative approach is central to integrating the Circular Economy across company value chains, a global sustainability megatrend that is highly material to Food & Beverage companies.

As such, WBCSD encourages engagement of multiple stakeholders and partnerships, such as The Consumer Goods Forum and Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Further, in order to integrate the Circular Economy more fully into its value chain, we advise on three key areas: water consumption and water regeneration, bio-economy (efficient use of agricultural goods and effective use of residuals) and packaging (exploring sustainable packaging design and effective partner in end of life management). By taking these actions, ThaiBev has the opportunity for impact at scale, and to create a legacy of sustainable leadership."

## Ani Kavookjian
**Sustainable Business and Finance, Bloomberg L.P.**

"The Company’s Executive Committee must have understanding of climate change issues and the transition to a low-carbon society, with its associated risks and opportunities. In this, the executive committee must manage the company’s survival and growth in many climate scenarios. Besides this, ThaiBev should prioritize the presentation of information on sustainability issues in formats which investors can understand and make comparisons.

Moreover, if the company shows support for TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), ThaiBev can attract investors who are interested in companies who prioritize long-term goals. Investors are now increasingly interested in companies from emerging/developing markets."



# The Process for Assessing Key Sustainability Issues

In 2018, ThaiBev assessed key sustainability issues through comparisons with its industry peers and by considering data on sustainability trends worldwide. Surveys found that there were no significant changes from 2017.

## 1. Identification of Issues
ThaiBev selects sustainability issues that are consistent with business operations, based on the information gathered from executives and experts from every business unit and relevant units, and from interviews of external experts on sustainability in the context of food and beverage business sustainability. This involves learning about global trends and changes, sustainability issues of other companies in the industry, as well as a survey of stakeholders on corporate sustainability issues held this year.

## 2. Issue Prioritization
ThaiBev takes the identified issues and ranks them by priority, considering each issue’s impact on business operations, and the opinions of all stakeholders about the possible impact on sustainability. Which issues get prioritized is determined by ThaiBev and its stakeholders.

## 3. Validation
The Corporate Sustainability Development Working Team cross-checks the comprehensiveness of the key corporate sustainability issues, and presents the completed list to the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee for review and approval. It then presents the issues to the executive committee for final approval and implementation.

## 4. Establishment of Reporting Boundary
ThaiBev determines the scope of the reporting of all 17 key issues, based on the information collected from various agencies and most relevant stakeholder groups, for the information to be comprehensive and accurate, and in order to address the issues of interest to ThaiBev’s stakeholders.

## 5. Continuous Development
ThaiBev is committed to continuously operating under the sustainable development framework, by taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives on key issues in the development of appropriate and fair sustainability practices.

# Governance, Risk and Compliance

ThaiBev is committed to operate its businesses with integrity, accountability, transparency and fairness, according to Code of Business Conduct of ThaiBev Group. Governance is a key factor that improves and streamlines ThaiBev’s relations between board members, executives, employees, and other stakeholders. ThaiBev believes that good governance provides a foundation for the mechanisms that set business objectives and the operational methods to achieve them, as well as monitoring the results. ThaiBev emphasizes principles of good corporate governance and appropriate risk management plans that follow sustainability policy.

Good Corporate Governance is an international corporate management method, that complies with ThaiBev’s Code of Business Conduct. This management system is fair and transparent, creating confidence for stakeholders and helps guide ThaiBev’s business to grow sustainably.

## Good Corporate Governance

ThaiBev has the intention for good corporate governance, along with a management system that’s efficient, transparent, and accountability. This means ThaiBev complies with all laws and regulations, and aims to be a role model: doing business professionally, transparently and ethically, to give total confidence to shareholders, investors, employees, customers, and stakeholders.

ThaiBev also reported on good corporate governance in its Annual Report 2018, which explained the structure and method of governance disclosure. The report also disclosed financial performance, a development plan for sustainability within the organization between board members, management and shareholders to further its competitiveness, and emphasized determination and support to develop our customers’ business potential for stronger and more sustainable growth, and adding value for shareholders in long term; while considering all stakeholders inside and outside the organization. ThaiBev has an annual knowledge-sharing plan on laws and regulations involving the Singapore Exchange; the Compliance Unit, Office of Corporate Secretariat, provides updates to the boards, executives, and employees. When there is any amendment of laws and regulations, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee will be informed in the meetings or via email, as the case may be.

Furthermore, ThaiBev announced the use of Whistleblowing Policy as a way to emphasize the importance of receiving and responding to the concerns about suspected wrongdoings within the Company, which was raised from directors, executives, and employees. In 2018, there were no significant incidents of conflict found and no significant cases of grievances related to ethics which were investigated and found to be valid.


# Code of Business Conduct

Business ethics are a key part of enabling business growth, stability, sustainability, and social acceptance. ThaiBev has established its Code of Business Conduct with the intention of emphasizing integrity, legal compliance, and the observance of morality and ethics. The executives, managers, and employees all have the responsibility to adhere to the Code of Business Conduct, so that ThaiBev achieves its objective of upholding ethical conduct and maintaining ethical standards.

ThaiBev has a duty to maintain transparency in its operations and protect the interests of its shareholders by considering market conditions and risk factors, both present and future. The company must act correctly towards employees, customers and all its trading partners. The company is committed that its employees truly understand the content and meaning of the Code of Business Conduct; at every level, ThaiBev personnel are bound to accept and follow the code. If every person connected with the company accepts and practices the Code of Business Conduct under the policy of good governance, the results shall be as follows:

- The company will uphold its responsibility toward society and all stakeholders
- Employees will work efficiently
- There will be fairness
- Employees will have dignity and integrity
- The company will be accepted by society
- The staff will be content

# Anti-Corruption

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of transparency and morality and adheres to the principles of fairness and compliance with the Code of Business Conduct, while striving to provide maximum benefits for all stakeholders in its business operations, in Thailand and abroad. ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy has established practices to protect against corruption, and to serve as a guideline for promoting business sustainability and stability in the future.

In the case of changes to the business, regulations, standards, and the law, the President and CEO is responsible to monitor and implement an efficient anti-corruption system, report to the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and review and revise policies to ensure they are up-to-date and responsive to any changes. The company has specified the roles and duties of all parties as follows:

- High-level executives are responsible for making sure that board members, supervisors and employees understand policy compliance, encouraging them to be vigilant and proactive.
- Board members and employees have the duty to maintain the highest standards when doing business.
- Employees must not turn away from, or neglect evidence of corruption.
- Employees must cooperate with investigations into the facts.

Failure to act in accordance with this policy is a severe disciplinary offence; it is a violation of the ThaiBev employment contract and a criminal offence. Furthermore, violating this policy may cause severe damage to the company’s reputation and status. If corruption is discovered, it should be reported to the employee’s line manager. If a person is discovered to commit an offence, they will be punished according to ThaiBev’s regulations and prosecuted under the law.

# Handling Complaints

ThaiBev has a policy that all employees are obligated to file a complaint if they discover an act that may be considered wrongdoing.

- If a board member has a complaint, the board member should file the complaint to the Chairman of the Board to investigate.
- If an employee has a complaint, the employee should file the complaint in writing through the recommended channels, giving their name and contact details and file it with a responsible company official.
- Every employee may report suspicious information directly to the President and CEO through the email whistleblowing@thaibev.com, or send it directly to executives.
- ThaiBev is ready to protect any employee who files a complaint with a factual basis; confidentiality will be maintained while taking strict action against wrongdoing.
- An employee filing a complaint will be free of repercussions or damage if the complaint is filed in good faith.
- Appropriate action will be taken to protect executives and employees from any harm that may arise from filing the complaint.

When an employee files a complaint, ThaiBev will decide how to proceed. If it is found afterwards that the complaint was false, corrupt, malicious, careless, or for personal benefit, this will be considered a disciplinary offence as stated in the ThaiBev Employee Handbook. Channels for filing complaints are publicized through the company’s internal media.

# Breaches of Regulations and the Law

ThaiBev requires that all employees must comply with its rules and regulations and the laws of countries that ThaiBev operates in. Any breach of applicable regulations in terms of ethics, organizational standards of excellence, or violations of human rights on the business premises must be stopped immediately and appropriate measures taken. In 2018, some minor cases were reported. Breaches were categorized by the monetary value of the action. Major cases involve a monetary value of 300,000 baht or more; minor cases involve less than 300,000 baht. To prevent breaches of the regulations, ThaiBev has set the following policies to reduce corruption:

1. ThaiBev provides orientation to new employees and executives.
2. Online training courses are provided.
3. ThaiBev communicates business ethics to employees and executives and makes efforts to ensure they understand.
4. ThaiBev strives to communicate the Code of Business Conduct to employees and executives and make sure they understand they are required to follow the code.
5. If fraud is discovered, decisive action will be taken. This may involve legal action.
6. Internal audits for corruption will be conducted periodically.

# ThaiBev and Public Policy

ThaiBev operates its business in accordance with the principles of corporate governance, with efficient management systems that are transparent and under a basic framework of fairness and accountability. ThaiBev participates with and supports state entities for commercial benefit and production, namely the Chamber of Commerce, Board of Trade of Thailand and the Federation of Thai Industries. This is to increase the company’s competitive potential and to create a strong network with other companies in the beverage sector. The company provides budgetary support and participates in the sharing of information. ThaiBev supports the activities of these entities, offering suggestions and guidelines for the common benefit of the business sector and consumers. ThaiBev has the intention of coordinating private and public policy, to support and promote industry in general, to develop and grow sustainably.

- **Financial support for the Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand** comes in the form of a membership fee. ThaiBev helps to facilitate and encourage correct practices that line up with the vision and plans determined by government policies, such as Announcements from the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministerial regulations and Excise regulations for the greatest benefit of the industry.

- **Financial support is provided for the Thai Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE)** through the Federation of Thai Industries, promoting the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. This is to support society’s dedication to conserving the environment.

- **Support is given to the Federation of Thai Industries** to grant research scholarships that study packaging management, in order to reduce environmental impacts and be more sustainable.

ThaiBev maintains a role in stating opinions and/or making decisions through the Board of Directors, or at the Annual General Meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand. In this way, ThaiBev stays informed about changes in regulations and specifications and has the opportunity to review government draft policies and regulations. This enables ThaiBev to develop measures to mitigate any possible impacts on business, and to formulate plans to cope with changes initiated by the government, while maintaining the company’s good reputation and creating the greatest benefit for the industry.

As for the Federation of Thai Industries, ThaiBev supports research and development for environmental sustainability and promotion of the 3Rs through communication channels, training, and exchanging knowledge between partners in the beverage industry. This includes cooperation with the private sector to dispose of packaging waste with integrated and sustainable solutions. This reduces environmental impacts in Thailand, and helps the state reduce waste management costs.


# RISK MANAGEMENT

- Risk management is imperative for current business operations, which are undergoing continuous change, to create confidence that ThaiBev can attain both short term and long term objectives and goals. Meanwhile, risk management can reduce losses and damages to an acceptable level, or even create business opportunities for ThaiBev to increase its competitiveness and growth.

- Therefore, ThaiBev has determined a systematic framework and approach for the management of any risk that might occur throughout the organization. Understanding has been created with management and every employee about opportunities and risks which may arise. There have also been plans formulated to mitigate risk with systems of monitoring, and evaluation of risk management to discover emerging risks in the future.

- Besides risks that may occur during normal operations, ThaiBev analyzes risks which might impact ThaiBev’s sustainability, and has found the following four significant changes in economic, social and environmental aspects:

  1. Changes in demographic structure and the onset of an aging society.
  2. Changes in climate.
  3. Changes in technology causing changes in business formats.
  4. Threats to the security and safety of information systems.

All of these are considered Emerging Risks which may hinder the business in reaching its goals and lead to losing business opportunities, as well as compromising the organization’s reputation, stability or sustainability.

## STORY

### Structure of Oversight and Risk Management

Divided into the corporate level and the product group or business unit level:

**At the corporate level:** There is a Sustainability and Risk Management Committee* (SRMC) which comprises ThaiBev directors and senior executives from each product group or business unit appointed by the Board of Directors. They are tasked with determining policies to manage sustainability and risk management, and strategically supervise the business in sustainable development effectively and efficiently. They are required to specify operational frameworks for ThaiBev’s risk management, including monitoring, screening, and giving ideas or suggestions in regards to the matters of concern.

**At the product group or business unit level:** Senior executives of each product group or business unit are tasked with controlling and monitoring risk management at their product groups or business units and reporting to the SRMC.

There are also risk coordinators of each product group or business unit who assist in supervising and monitoring risk management operations in their product groups or business units, including coordinating with the Corporate Risk Management Working Team.

In addition to the management of risks which may arise in normal operations in each product group or business unit, ThaiBev also manages risks associated with strategic planning, investment, and setting business plans which have been considered by the relevant committees, such as the Raw Material Procurement Committee, the Management Committee, the Investment Committee, or the Executive Committee. Corporate risk must be reported to the Company’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, to be confident that every risk is managed according to the specified measures.

*Note: On November 23, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors Meeting No. 5/2017 approved the renaming of the “Risk Management Committee” to the “Sustainability and Risk Management Committee” and extending the scope of its responsibilities to cover the oversight of strategies to bring about efficient and effective sustainable development.


# Risk Management Process

ThaiBev's risk management process is Integrated Risk Management, divided into two different kinds: **Top-down and Bottom-up Enterprise Risk Management**. For instance, senior management has a role in identifying and evaluating ThaiBev’s strategic risk by analyzing the relevant internal and external factors, and considering a risk management plan alongside business plans, yearly operational plans and investment plans, with the continuous follow-up of risk management.

At the operational level, the head of a department and its staff must identify and evaluate operational risks, develop a risk management plan, implement it and report the results continuously at every level, from department and subsidiary company to product group or business unit, and at the corporate level.

Integrated Risk Management comprises the following procedures:

1. **Define objectives** of ThaiBev and the product groups or business units to be consistent.
2. **Identify risks** faced by ThaiBev or the business units, or those which are latent in operations, which may arise and have a negative impact on ThaiBev or the business achieving its goals.
3. **Analyze and assess risks** to find their cause; categorize and prioritize existing risks by evaluating the chances of a risk incident, and the impact or level of severity of the damage that might occur.
4. **Plan risk management actions**.
5. **Implement the action plan**.
6. **Follow up, report and evaluate risk management** by comparing Key Risk Indicators, specified as criteria to evaluate the results of operations for middle management upwards.

# Culture of Risk Management

To engender knowledge and understanding and to instill risk management into the awareness of every employee, and develop it to be part of corporate culture in order to help ThaiBev to grow sustainably, the following measures have been taken:

- Held special trainings in risk management for the risk coordinators of each product group or business unit, as well as training activities for employees and orientation sessions for new employees. These are to understand ThaiBev’s risk factors, the processes of risk management, and the management tools used to address risk consistently in both general and particular cases. This is to prepare our employees for any incident which may occur in the course of operations, whether short term, medium term, or long term.

- Encouraged and supported employees to discuss or communicate matters of risk or safety at ThaiBev, including proposing opinions about managing risk in meetings and at training sessions.

- Established internal agencies such as the Office of Legal Affairs, the Compliance Unit of the Office of Corporate Secretariat, the Corporate Risk Management Working Team, and the Office of Internal Audit to examine and monitor operations, and give advice and suggestions on improving operations for product groups, business units and other departments across the organization.

- Initiated the Ways of Work Awards (WOW Awards) project for employees to present projects which may be a concept or method of operations which supports the ThaiBev’s sustainable development. Employees may enter the WOW Awards competition, which is judged by senior management. They choose work that is interesting and will benefit ThaiBev when implemented in real life contexts.

Besides this, employees can report potential risks to ThaiBev in writing to their line managers, or they can report to the Office of the President and CEO using the dedicated email account, after which the President and CEO will consider and take further actions deemed appropriate.



# Moving Forward

## Moving Forward to Cope with Emerging Risks

### 1. Risks from changes in demographic structure and the onset of an aging society, which include:

- The increase of the older population in many countries including Thailand, which is bringing about a society of the elderly, in which the proportions of working age people and children are reduced.
- Changes in consumer behavior featuring a greater interest in health.
- Consumers are consuming a wide range of goods and services with an expectation of improved quality and higher standards.
- The government sector prioritizes promoting health among the elderly to reduce the burdens of care, and provides health services to the elderly, including through the amendment of various relevant regulations concerning goods and services in order to impact consumers’ health and safety.

### How important is innovation to ThaiBev growth?

Innovation is an important key to our long-term success. It enables ThaiBev to maintain our leadership in sustainability. At a time when the business situation is highly uncertain and competitive, and where consumer behaviors change rapidly, innovation is what differentiates the brand and gives choices to consumers. ThaiBev uses innovation to evolve production processes to gain a competitive advantage, or to improve the quality of the working environment for employees. Innovation is also leveraged to reduce impacts on the environment and society.

### How does ThaiBev foster a culture of innovation?

The most important factor to develop an organization is its people. So opportunities are given to employees to propose new ideas and put them into practice, as well as continuous support and training. This is the ThaiBev corporate culture and what inspired us to launch the WOW Awards 2018, to discover our colleagues’ best projects and ideas in the ThaiBev group of companies around the world. The method of working with knowledge and expertise is an internal process which has been applied to create the ThaiBev Way of Work. It yields creative innovations that can be a model for mutual learning, yielding great benefits.

### How are innovation and sustainability connected?

Innovation facilitates sustainability. When the availability and prices of resources fluctuate, innovation enables their efficient use, so less resources are used for greater benefit. For instance, the Less is More project showed that the use of PET resin pellets reduced the weight of plastic bottles from 15.5 grams to 13.5 grams, while an innovative design actually improved the quality of the containers. It made our people aware of continuous development, a key factor in sustainability.

## BevTech

- **Mechanization**
- **Engineering Management Center**
- **Technology Development**
- **Corporate Quality Management System**
- **Turnkey Provider**
- **Packaging Business**
- **Engineering Excellence**

BevTech Co., Ltd. was established by ThaiBev as a technology and engineering hub with the aim of Mechanization and Automation. A team of experienced engineers and scientists was assembled from various departments to research and develop advanced technology for production machinery and robotics. This will bring more automation and robotics to ThaiBev’s factories. The intention is to boost competitiveness by increasing the efficiency and quality of production, as well as increasing employee safety and reducing the risk of labor shortages. Most importantly, it will reduce waste and energy usage. Many kinds of machinery are currently used in production processes, such as robotic arms to sort products on pallets, automatic carton box insert machines and automatic bottle-sorting machines. Awareness is also being raised among employees about continuous development, a key factor in developing sustainable innovation.


# Automatic bottle–sorting conveyor belt

BevTech Co., Ltd. cooperated with Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd., a company tasked with purchasing, procuring, transporting, and adding value to packaging, to create an automatic bottle–sorting conveyor belt that uses robotic arms to replace human labor. Immediate benefits included:

- **Improve employees’ working conditions and safety.**
- **Boosting working capability** by using machinery and robotics, where it was possible to reduce human labor, by 60 percent.
- **Improving the quality of bottles** with the ability to inspect for foreign bodies both large and small with the Vision Inspector (VI) system, a sensor to detect foreign particles in the bottle. This signals the machinery to weed out substandard bottles from the process, increasing confidence in the quality of bottles being used in the production process.

A mechanical arm has been developed that lift boxes from a pallet and packs and unpacks glass bottles in and out of the carton boxes. This project received The Winner and the Spark Inspirations awards at the WOW Awards 2018, a contest to find the best creative work and ideas from employees in the ThaiBev group of companies, from a total of 84 entries. The award is for work that boosts working efficiency. This can create intellectual property for the company, as well as improve quality of life in the workplace. It develops the technical expertise of employees and assists the upgrade from manual to skilled labor.


# Rice Milk Beverage Product

Rice Milk is a healthy beverage made from the best rice, carefully selected from premium locations all over Thailand, including:

1. **Brown jasmine rice from Thung Kula Rong Hai district, Roi-Et Province**: A growing region promoted as a source for export-standard jasmine rice by the Cooperatives Promotion Department. The jasmine rice from this area is more fragrant than jasmine rice from elsewhere, due to the local topology, climate, and soil nutrients that encourage fragrant oils (2AP).

2. **Chan Ka Pak brand jasmine rice**: The jasmine rice 105 strain produced by the Charoen Pokphand Pensiri Centre for Plant Development in Surin Province. The Chaipatana Foundation controls the quality of rice strains and uses a meticulous production process, from preparing the paddy to harvest. It is planted by hand and must only be harvested by hand or by a clean harvesting machine to prevent contamination with other rice strains or red rice grains.

Rice milk provides energy and protein. Drinking rice milk enhances digestion. It is cholesterol-free, and a source of unsaturated vegetable oils, suitable for a healthy diet.

# Moving Forward

Continuous innovation has enabled ThaiBev to register intellectual property with the Department of Intellectual Property to introduce creative sustainable ideas that can be further developed and used commercially.

ThaiBev filed patents and petty patents with the Department of Intellectual Property, Ministry of Commerce.

**130** applications have been filed and accumulated through 2018.


# Consumer Health, Safety and Wellbeing

- Using carefully selected raw materials that meet our company’s high quality standards, ThaiBev goes an extra step to ensure that our raw materials are also traceable to the producer. By doing this, ThaiBev wants to give consumers confidence that ThaiBev’s raw materials are safe and healthy as based on nutritional principles, are of high quality, and comply with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

- ThaiBev seeks to maintain high quality and safety throughout the entire supply chain – from sourcing to storage, transportation, production and eventual distribution. This is validated through our ISO 22000, NSF, BRC and GMP/HACCP certifications.

- ThaiBev undertakes continuous research and development to increase our range of healthier products while maintaining the nutritious benefits and good taste that consumers need. Research shows that 80 percent of consumers approve of ThaiBev’s ready to drink tea and drinking water products as healthy, clean and safe.

- ThaiBev gives consumers complete nutritional information on the product labelling, including the amounts of sugar, fat and sodium, as required by law and as guided by nutrition regulations.

## Insight

Food is our product. Therefore, safety is our highest priority. In whatever business, we must be confident in what we are doing. If we offer food products to the public, we must be confident to consume them ourselves and recommend them to friends and family. This is the basic ethical duty of the food industry, not just putting out anything we have made. These days, shoppers are concerned about nutrition and food safety, and we want everyone to co-exist sustainably.

For OISHI, we have developed systems and store supervision that conform to the GMP, HACCP and ISO standards certified by a leading global company in systems verifying, SGS. We are especially proud to be the only food business to have received these verifications, not only in Thailand, but also in Asia, for all brands and stores under OISHI. It makes us proud to say to all of our employees and customers that we offer the highest quality products with confidence in our auditing processes and work systems. Being the leader isn’t easy and we have had to maintain these standards continuously, which cover every aspect of quality. The world is continually changing and we have to improve our systems to keep up with each era of change. Finally, we must also evolve to match consumers’ changing behaviors and lifestyles, so that we can continue to grow with our customers and society sustainably.

As the number of consumers grows together with us, we are fully aware of the responsibility we have to them. High quality and safe products are standard requirements that we will always guarantee to deliver.

We also want to go one step further to be a part of our consumer’s healthier choices and active lifestyles. There has been a call for more products with lower sugar and more nutritional benefits. We have answered that call by launching new products with lower sugar and also reducing the amount of sugar in existing products. In the long term, we will continue to be dedicated to our customers and want to be a part of looking after customers’ health and nutrition.

# Healthy Product

## Reducing Sodium in Products

Besides sugar, which causes obesity and diabetes, the intake of sodium also poses risks by leading to kidney disease. Currently, over 8 million people in Thailand are affected with chronic kidney disease, making it the third highest country in ASEAN. As a food producer, ThaiBev is giving priority to reducing sodium in our products. At present, examples of menus that reduce sodium or have no sodium added include salmon head in soy sauce and miso soup.

## Trans Fat–Free

Trans fat is a form of fat that is hazardous to health as it increases one’s levels of bad cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) which are indicators for stroke and cardiovascular disease. In 2018, the Ministry of Public Health announced a ban on the production, importation or sale of food containing Partially Hydrogenated Oils (PHOs). All of OISHI’s food products and raw materials contain no PHOs to make food safe for consumption.

## OISHI Sandwich Plus Tuna, Mushroom and Quinoa Flavour

OISHI has developed multigrain bread made from four grains: wheat, barley, riceberry rice and soybeans. This is combined with tuna which gives the benefits of protein, low fat and omega-3 oils for brain health. Then there is quinoa which is full of fiber, vitamin E, vitamin B, iron and potassium, giving nutritional value and high energy.

## Insight

**Ueychai Tantha-Ōbhas**  
Director and Senior Executive Vice President,  
and Chief Operation Officer - Thailand

Customers are important stakeholders of our organization and are a key variable enabling us to achieve our objectives. Therefore, we must help develop the potential of customers to work with us efficiently to get our products into consumers’ hands. ThaiBev will prosper if consumers are satisfied with our products; it is they who will consume our products and make repeat purchases. This is a key factor for business success. In summary, customers are important. Therefore, customer management cannot be forced. We must try to get customers to work with us happily, to be satisfied and profitable, so they will stay with us.


# Managing Distribution Channels

To manage distribution channels, ThaiBev makes the following distinctions by group:

## Customers

This group brings ThaiBev’s products to consumers and creates customer satisfaction with ThaiBev’s products among the public to inspire loyalty. These include:

1. **Traditional Trade**: Selling through a system of distributors in each province and district.

2. **Modern Trade**: Selling through modern trade retail stores such as Makro, Tesco Lotus, Big C, 7-Eleven, Tops Supermarket, The Mall, and local modern trade retailers such as CJ (Ratchaburi, Petchaburi, Samut Songkhram, and other provinces), TMK (Kanchanaburi), or Supercheap (Phuket).

3. **Trading through ThaiBev’s Cash Van**, which travels to retail stores in each community, such as mom and pop shops, welfare stores, local restaurants, and grocery stores in government offices and hospitals.

4. **Trading channels** such as Hotels, Restaurants, and Catering/tourism businesses (HoReCa).

5. **Trading with restaurants and licensed entertainment venues** (On Trade/On Premises) such as pubs, bars, restaurants, and open-air dining venues.

## Consumers

To whom ThaiBev sells directly. We strive for consumer satisfaction. We want our customers to be happy and have excellent experiences so they will make repeat purchases, through the following channels:

1. **Through ThaiBev’s restaurants under a variety of brands**, such as:
   - OISHI, comprising OISHI Grand, OISHI Eaterium, OISHI Japanese Buffet, Nikuya, Shabushi, OISHI Ramen, and Kakashi*.
   - Food of Asia, including So Asean Café’ & Restaurant, Man Fu Yuan Kitchen, Baan Suriyasai, Food Street, Hyde & Seek, mx cakes & bakery, Cafe Chilli, Chilli Thai Restaurant, Eat Pot by Café Chilli, Pot Ministry, South Tiger and KFC. (only outlets managed by subsidiary companies of ThaiBev: QSA)**

2. **Through online and website channels** (https://oishidelivery.com/th), by mobile phone or computer, or OISHI Delivery 1773. These channels cater to the lifestyles of the younger generation and urbanites, emphasizing convenience and quality.

# Measuring/evaluating Customer Satisfaction

ThaiBev has a variety of distribution channels that emphasize reaching a large number of customers and expanding service coverage. To provide customers with the most efficient service, ThaiBev has various methods to measure, monitor, and evaluate customer and consumer satisfaction according to the needs, expectations and business operations of customers and consumers in different distribution channels:

- **Traditional Trade**: These are distributors in each province who order in large volumes. They distribute a full range of fresh and new products, in pristine packaging. Measurement and evaluation of customer satisfaction focuses on readiness, the condition of products ordered, the ability to completely fill desired orders, and the service provided by delivery teams when the product reaches the customer.

- **HoReCa channels**: Customers expect and rely on the skills, advice and knowledge-sharing of sales staff, including the Serve Responsibly program, and service of sales staff to provide accurate and timely information about products sold in the customer’s restaurant or hotel. This includes the provision of promotional materials for use at the point of sale. The HoReCa Management team surveys customer satisfaction with questionnaires that use Scanned QR Codes, that can be sent online for transparency. This gives the customer the ability to provide feedback in their evaluations and send the results to ThaiBev.

- **Consumers**: Monitoring and measuring satisfaction are determined by the convenience, speed, and quality of consumer experiences across different distribution channels. For instance, when customers patronize restaurants in the ThaiBev chain, customer satisfaction surveys are used to evaluate satisfaction levels immediately though a QR Code on their receipt. The results are monitored and reported back to the customer (if they request additional information). In the case of telephone orders on OISHI Delivery 1773, customers can also call to complain and offer their opinions through this customer service line.

# Enhancing Customers’ Capabilities

ThaiBev places high priority on increasing customers’ capabilities, skills and knowledge, so they can compete efficiently in their business environment. As such, the company has organized a number of training sessions, aiming at disseminating experience from ThaiBev executives, as well as outside experts, to enhance customers’ competitive capabilities. Example of such sessions include:


# Agent Next Generation Development (Next Gen)

This project aims to enhance the capabilities and efficiency of our Traditional Trade distributors (Agent) and their successors (Next Gen). The program has been organized over the last three consecutive years and covered a comprehensive range of subjects, including:

- **Cash Van Route Planning**: 
  - Agents’ van sales team distributing product directly to retail outlets.
  - Focus on optimizing route plans to ensure maximum outlet coverage.
  - Minimize route overlap to increase product availability and reach consumers.

- **Agent Sales Personnel Development**:
  - Includes Begin-of-the-day planning, Sales driver inspection, Store visit objectives, Opening/Closing sales, Merchandizing, and End-of-day review.
  - Objectives for each sales team to clearly understand their roles and increase professionalism with tangible measurements.

- **Daily Performance Review and Target-Setting**:
  - Through Morning Talk to reinforce the importance of daily sales targets.
  - Plans to achieve targets, anticipate challenges, and provide solutions to overcome such challenges.

- **Field Coaching**:
  - On-the-job training with ThaiBev.
  - Enables the transfer of experiences, reinforcement of standard store visit procedures, and multiplication of practices to other sales colleagues.

- **Daily Sales Report**:
  - Summarizing both daily and accumulated sales performance.
  - Key learning and areas of improvement for continuous development and planning to achieve monthly sales targets.

In addition, ThaiBev invests in programs to jointly work with agents to develop their sales teams in the field. For example, ThaiBev worked closely with an agent in Sawankhalok district, Sukhothai province, with the target to increase the agent’s van sales by 40 percent. Through close collaboration, the program managed to increase the agent’s sales by 56 percent (vis a vis the original target of 40 percent) and, more importantly, increased the agent’s satisfaction and confidence in a long-term stable and sustainable partnership with ThaiBev.


# Sustainability Report 2018

## Insight

**Chamnanwit Aphichattrakul**  
Agent: Aphichart Nam Thip Ltd. Part.  
Sawankhalok district, Sukhothai Province

### What were your feelings and what did you get from being an agent in the Next Gen project, and the cash van development project in Sawankhalok?

I am very impressed with the collaboration with ThaiBev to develop my sales team. The support from ThaiBev is by far much better than other companies we have worked with. Such collaboration exists throughout all levels. ThaiBev’s front line team and their managers have a regular call plan to visit us and our customers (sub-agents) and support us to achieve our targets. In addition, there is a monthly meeting where all senior ThaiBev managers meet with us to listen to our problems and jointly develop plans to support agents in all of their responsible regions.

Since I joined the Next Gen program, I have learned and gained new perspectives about techniques and methods to manage my business in various aspects. For instance, cash van management, market surveys, managing relationships with sub-agents and retail shops, managing inventory or monthly sales plans, all of which were adapted for use with Aphichart Nam Thip and enable us to better manage our sales areas. Rather than just being a stock keeper, we need to be more proactive and reach out to our sub-agents and retail shops to understand their needs, how to better service them and, thus, increase our competitiveness in our market.

As for the pilot program to develop our cash van sales operations in Sawankhalok, we must thank the Channel Business Development team and all other stakeholders who provided opportunities to first-hand train our sales personnel, enhance our knowledge, and increase the level of our sales team’s professionalism. For instance, we started recording and making use of our sales data to drive performance through our daily Morning Talk, promoted friendly competition among our sales teams, as well as hands-on field coaching and monthly planning to set sales targets, anticipate challenges and develop corresponding solutions to achieve our targets.

The Next Gen program and cash van pilot program have delivered a very satisfactory result. Comparing sales from January to April 2018, our April sales increased by 90 percent compared to before the program started. In particular, sales of non-alcoholic beverages jumped by 319 percent compared to last year.

## Program of Training for Restaurants and Sales by HoReCa Management team

Horeca Management Co., Ltd. started the business over the past 3 years in Hotel and Premium Restaurant Channels. The emphasis is on professional service, including product quality and after service, through various activities and programs. For instance, Beer and Spirits Factory Visit, Perfect Serve Product Training and Serve Responsibility Program, which is one of our key sessions to demonstrate to customers how to serve responsibly to end consumers.


# Inviting Trading Partners to Factory Tour for Product Knowledge Training

Factory tours are a key strategy to enhance customer perspectives on quality, cleanliness, and world-standard production processes. ThaiBev has invited customers to visit the brewery factory in Wang Noi, Ayutthaya (Cosmos Brewery (Thailand) Co., Ltd) and the distillery of Mekhong (Sura Bangyikhan Co., Ltd.). Knowledge is shared on how to keep and serve beverages appropriately. For example, draught beer should not be kept more than 3 months in storage. ThaiBev also emphasizes the concept of "FEFO" (First Expired, First Out). Additionally, beer temperature should be at 4 – 8 degrees Celsius to ensure the best taste (Perfect Serve); and 45 degrees is the perfect angle to pour beer to create the best foam.

## Insight

### Chulapat Charoenloet
**Principal Bartender #FindThePhotoBooth**

The feelings I got from the visit were good feelings, because while I work in the beverage trade, it is the first time in my life that I have seen a real distillery, how it works. Where usually I had learned from theory or just from pictures, today I saw a real distillery and listened to experts teaching us about distilling, Mekhong and ThaiBev products. This was impressive.

I enjoyed getting to know about distilling spirits. In the Gallery there was a beautiful model of the distillery and I understood the history of Mekhong, which has a long history alongside that of the Thai people.

### Nitisak Laphirun
**Floor Manager #FindTheLockerRoom**

I felt that this visit was a great experience, and I learned a lot of new things about Thai spirits.

I most liked going into the distillery to see the real thing, about which I have read a lot. I have read books about producing spirits, but today I saw the real thing and how it is really done.


# Serve Responsibly

ThaiBev believes in the importance of serving alcoholic beverages responsibly. The desire exists to educate service staff and representatives of our customers to serve alcoholic drinks with awareness of consumers; for example, not serving alcohol to drinkers who are not in a physical state to drink any more, to reduce problems which might occur in society. ThaiBev thus organized practical training to give legal and medical advice, inviting experts such as doctors, police officers, and lawyers to talk about the effects on the body from consuming alcohol, including methods to serve responsibly. After completing the course, ThaiBev presented certificates to participants to certify that they had passed the training on serving alcohol responsibly. ThaiBev has organized this training on five occasions, inviting hotels and premium stores customers to participate for three sessions in Bangkok, one session in Cha-am, and one session in Pattaya, with a total of 300 participants.

Studies have found that a bartender or alcohol server provides service to an average of 20 consumers per day, or 500 per month, or 6,000 per year (calculated from 25 working days per month). Therefore, if 200 serving staff attend the training every year, ThaiBev expects these staff to warn as many as 1,200,000 drinkers every year.

This project is consistent with the third UN Sustainable Development Goal (Health and Wellbeing) with respect to drinking alcohol at dangerous levels, defined according to the country’s context. After starting this project, it was found that serving staff taking the training were able to apply the knowledge in their work and stop serving customers who were in a physical state where they should not consume any more alcohol, (with social responsibility our serve reduction would be 33 percent).

## Future Targets

- Expanding the program to premium hotels and restaurants at various locations around the country, emphasizing the major cities of each region such as Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Nakhon Ratchasima and Phuket.

- In 2019, the target is for 50-60 participants at each event, from approximately 30 hotels and restaurants. Three events will be held in 2019, with a target of 150-180 participants.

- There are plans for additional activities, including a video clip competition under the title of Serve Responsibly, which would be part of this program to use in training, to expand knowledge among people in society and instill awareness to make society safer and better.



Boworn Pongsuphap  
Captain, Anantara Sathorn Hotel, Bangkok

After doing this training, we had more understanding of the safety and health of consumers, whereas before, we'd just think that serving the consumers to be happy and satisfied was enough. I must thank ThaiBev very much for giving me this knowledge.



Yongyut Udompat  
Wine Guru, Anantara Riverside Bangkok Resort Hotel

This training gave both knowledge and enjoyment from the Workshop activities and made me understand why we must “Serve Responsibly”. I will pass this knowledge on to my colleagues for them to use.



Prapassorn Boonthongchuay  
Supervisor, Laksasubha Hua Hin Hotel

Thanks to ThaiBev for giving the opportunity to join this great program. It made me realize how to serving more responsibly. ThaiBev is not only about producing and selling, but doing things for society, so Thai society will be better.



### MOVING FORWARD

Although there are already methods in place to measure and evaluate customer satisfaction in each distribution channel, ThaiBev continues to develop and introduce modern technology to its customers and consumers of its products, enabling customers to communicate with ThaiBev more easily. For example, customers or restaurants in the ThaiBev chain can express their opinions through the QR Code. Customers of restaurants in the Oishi Group can use the Oishi Pointo mobile app to convert their spending into points, which can be collected and used instead of cash, without the need for a membership card.



# SUSTAINABLE SOURCING

- Procurement is the process of selecting and procuring quality raw materials for production. ThaiBev has implemented the Supplier Code of Practice as a standard for suppliers’ operations in order to reduce the potential impacts on production, the environment, society and the business. It also specifies measures to suspend trading with any supplier who violates the Code of Practice, or any supplier who does not take corrective actions to address a complaint.

- Determining measures to screen suppliers and strictly inspect quality, with priority given to reducing impacts on the environment and society; and to ensure that products have high quality and are sourced through procurement processes with high standards and environmental and social responsibility.

- Supporting local suppliers with the objective to promote national economic growth and develop the capability of local suppliers to be equal to their international peers, and distribute income to local communities to help them become more self-reliant.

- Managing risk by assessing material criticality according to procurement spend and risk levels in procurement, to prioritize and mitigate risk efficiently.


# Centralized Procurement

ThaiBev uses a Centralized Procurement approach, which specifies frameworks and control of procurement from a central department, in order to gain more bargaining power and enhance competitive advantage in cost management. The most important aspect of this strategy is the control of quality and transparency in the procurement process, with suppliers categorized into two groups according to the merchandise they are supplying as follows:

1. **Direct Materials** are merchandise that are product components or used directly in the production process. They are not diverse but their procurement spend is high. They are categorized into packaging, commodities, and chemicals.

2. **Indirect Materials** are other merchandise not under Direct Materials which ensure business continuity. Procurement spend is not high, but covers a wide range of merchandise such as machinery, spare parts, and consumables, etc.

- **Suppliers**: >2,500
- **Procurement Spend in 2018**: >40,000 Million Baht

## Proportion of Procurement Spend

| Category                  | Percentage |
|---------------------------|------------|
| **Direct Materials**      | 66%        |
| Packaging                 | 59%        |

| Construction              | 27%        |
| Machinery                 | 26%        |
| Materials handling        | 21%        |
| POP/POS/Premium           | 15%        |
| Services, IT & office automation | 6%  |
| Consumables               | 5%         |

## Local Suppliers and Procurement Spend

- **Local Suppliers**: 96%

| Year | Local Suppliers | Local Procurement Spend |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 2014 | 98%             | 91%                     |

| 2018 | 96%             | 91%                     |

### Notes

1. "Local supplier" means a supplier operating in a country in which ThaiBev has a production base and who directly supplies the ThaiBev group.
2. Data in 2014 covered procurement of goods and services only for ThaiBev spirits and beer business groups in Thailand.
3. Data in 2015 onward covered procurement of goods and services only for ThaiBev spirits, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages business groups in Thailand.
4. Data in 2016 covered the period from January to September 2016 as ThaiBev adjusted its fiscal year structure.
5. Data in 2017 covered the period from October 2016 to September 2017.

# Sustainable Sourcing Policy

ThaiBev has announced the enforcement of the **Supplier Code of Practice** to establish a standard for suppliers’ business operations beyond financial aspects. The Code covers environmental and social aspects and corporate governance, encouraging suppliers to apply the Code in their business operations and communicate it to their suppliers. A target has been set for 100% of suppliers doing business with the company to comply with the Code by 2020, as part of disseminating sustainable procurement practices and creating a sustainable supply chain at the national level. This aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 (UN SDG 12), promoting public procurement practices that are sustainable and in accordance with national policies and priorities.

### Key Areas
- **Business Ethics**
- **Human Rights**
- **Environmental Management**
- **Occupational Health and Safety**

### Ratio of Suppliers Complying with Supplier Code of Practice

| Year | Compliance Ratio |
|------|------------------|
| 2016 | 12%             |
| 2017 | 51%             |
| 2018 | 69%             |
| 2020 | 100%            |

### Enforcing the Code of Practice

ThaiBev has specified responsibility in enforcing the Supplier Code of Practice from management at the highest levels of the organization to operational levels, communicating with suppliers regularly through online channels. This includes sharing the vision of executives at the annual Business Partner Conference to ensure that every stage of the procurement process is consistent with the company’s strategies, policies, and operating targets.

- **Chief Supply Chain Management**: Formulate supply chain strategy and sustainability objectives
- **Managing Director of Procurement Unit**: Establish procurement policy in alignment with the strategy and objectives
- **Procurement Manager**: Oversee procurement operation and ensure compliance with the policy, strategy, and objectives
- **Procurement Officer**: Procure goods and services in compliance with the policy, strategy, and objectives

# Identifying Critical Materials and Suppliers

ThaiBev identifies critical materials and suppliers based on procurement spend and risk levels to prioritize and mitigate risk efficiently. This involves considering high spend merchandise items (materials) and suppliers, risk levels, and the impact on the company’s revenues.

- **26 Critical Tier 1 suppliers**

## Insight

**Saroj Chayavivatkul**  
President, Thai Beverage Can Limited

ThaiBev’s Supplier Award Program drives us to constantly develop ourselves so that we can compete with other suppliers in terms of costs, quality and standards. It also helps us to be aware of doing business on the basis of sustainability, with responsibility to our stakeholders. In the near future we will also introduce sustainable business practices to our own suppliers to create a sustainable beverage can supply chain locally.


# Managing Non-tier 1 Suppliers

Non-tier 1 suppliers are suppliers that do not directly supply goods and services to the company. However, ThaiBev is aware of their impacts on procurement processes. ThaiBev has established criteria for risk assessment, which identify critical non-tier 1 suppliers based on both business impact and sustainability factors; for example, dependency and market influence, their contribution to a sustainable supply chain, and the frequency of sustainability risks detected.

- **31** Critical Non-tier 1 suppliers
- **100%** Migrant labor legally hired and treated equally

The company has cooperated with logistics outsourcing companies, who are encouraged to give migrant labor the rights and welfare equal to local labor, and undergo registration required as specified by the law.

# Moving Forward

## Targets

The company has set short term and long term targets for procurement in alignment with the sustainability development practice.

### Short term targets for 2020

- **100%** of new suppliers undergo a sustainability assessment
- **100%** of critical suppliers are audited on-site
- **100%** of suppliers submit corrective action plans to address complaints following ThaiBev’s requirements

### Long term targets for 2025

- **100%** Tier 1 suppliers being assessed on a regular basis

**Definition**: Supplier is defined as a manufacturer, distributor, contractor or service provider.


# LIMITLESS OPPORTUNITIES

- ThaiBev’s Limitless Opportunities initiative is designed to provide employees the opportunity to build capabilities and advancement (Career Opportunities), build strong relationships and networks (Connectivity Opportunities), and to make a difference and bring benefits to society (Contribution Opportunities). ThaiBev grows with our employees and ensures that they have the opportunity to learn and develop skills and competencies that lead to mutual success.

- ThaiBev has seven strategies of human capital management to strengthen employees’ development to support continuous business growth, create oneness in the organization and prepare employees for transformation.


# 7 Strategies for Human Capital Management

1. **Clear Structure and Roles**
2. **Market-oriented Compensation and Benefits**
3. **Recognition-based Performance Management**
4. **Holistic High Performer Development**
5. **Proactive Succession and Workforce Planning**
6. **Strategic Talent Acquisition and Onboarding**
7. **Engaging Corporate Culture**



## Global Values

ThaiBev Global Values are the shared values of the ThaiBev Group. These values aim to create a sense of oneness and push ThaiBev forward to become Asia’s leading food and beverage company.

The Global Values consist of three key elements that ThaiBev expects employees to embrace and implement consistently.

### Collaboration
We leverage the power of inherent strengths and diversity to create inclusive synergies and commit to team goals.

### Creating Values
We empower our people with passion to apply new ideas and grasp opportunities to create positive impacts.

### Caring for Stakeholders
We embrace our stakeholders’ perspectives with good intentions and the right mindset to bring them into long-term sustainability together.


# Strategy 1: Clear Structure and Roles

- ThaiBev’s organizational structure clearly defines the responsibilities of each employee as well as efficiently connects cross-functional jobs at the individual, team, and department levels. It also serves as a mechanism to support the implementation of strategic plans for each line of work, which will lead to continuous improvement and business competitiveness.

- ThaiBev’s organizational structure helps to build on strengths and meet business needs, leading ThaiBev to gain competitiveness. ThaiBev’s corporate structure takes the form of a product group, strategic support group, and corporate functions group, covering entities in and outside Thailand. Collaboration between all groups leads to our strategic imperatives of growth, diversity, brand, reach and professionalism.

- The organizational structure evolves according to business needs with an increasing number of employees and functions. Such rapid growth is partly due to mergers and acquisitions, resulting in the increased possibility of redundant administrative costs. Therefore, constantly monitoring and reviewing the organizational structure design and management roles has significant influence on reducing costs, and increasing productivity and business competitiveness, to achieve our “Vision 2020” objectives.



# INSIGHT

**Panupong Petchaboon**  
Office of Legal

Originally, I only saw growth opportunities within my own department; however, when I attended ThaiBev’s seminar, I saw a very open organizational structure with lots of opportunities. The important thing is that I have learned from top executives, especially the CEO, Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, who goes to such lengths to encourage our goal-setting and to live a challenging life. Even though I am a new member of the organization, I feel inspired to learn about the opportunities within ThaiBev and strive to do my best.

# STORY

In addition to meeting the fast-changing business environment, ThaiBev has continued to invest in improving structures and management roles within the organization. ThaiBev adopted a position evaluation methodology that assesses the work quality of each position in accordance with international standards. It is applied to all positions throughout ThaiBev, resulting in internal job mobility and further opportunities for career advancement for employees. In addition, the job evaluation and job placement strategy, carried out in accordance with international standards, is an important tool for business expansion as mergers and acquisitions are effectively integrated.

# Strategy 2: Market-oriented Compensation and Benefits

To become the best employer and sustainability leader in ASEAN, ThaiBev has set up an effective compensation and benefit management system that is clear and adaptable to ThaiBev’s business direction.

- ThaiBev manages compensation equitably and is competitive with other companies within the same industry. ThaiBev has worked with a leading international company to ensure methods for providing compensation and benefits are comparable to appropriate market reference, and in line with ThaiBev’s business goals.

- To enhance quality of life and ensure employee wellbeing, ThaiBev provides benefits for employees, such as medical expense support, an annual health checkup, accident insurance and life insurance.

- ThaiBev has also set up a job evaluation system under the organizational structure, which is based on international standards and can be benchmarked to the market.



- To motivate determined and dedicated employees by rewarding them with suitable incentives according to their ability and individual performance, ThaiBev has created a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) that provides management with the opportunity to attain ownership through company shares as a reward for their continuous dedication, which in turn helps ThaiBev retain valuable human capital over the long term.

- Group privileges are given to employees to enhance their association with ThaiBev, such as discounts at affiliated restaurants and hotels, and on medical treatments and ThaiBev products.

### INSIGHT

**Dr. Agapol Na Songkhla**  
Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer

ThaiBev aims to be an admired and sustainable organization. Therefore, the philosophy of compensation and benefits reflects our attentiveness to work in various positions, ranging from operational employees who are located throughout the country, to the new generation of employees, whose values and lifestyles reflect rapid changes in society, as well as the managers and executives who face the challenges of multinational business management. ThaiBev’s compensation and benefits system has been designed to be suitably adjusted to all job levels in each company and reflects the recruitment situation in each country in which ThaiBev operates.

At the same time, ThaiBev is committed to promoting employee growth and engagement over the long run as well as strengthening business competitiveness. ThaiBev constantly strives to develop its employees, and promote career growth, enabling the expansion of the business to be based on a strong human capital foundation and increasing ThaiBev’s regional competitiveness.

### Strategy 3: Recognition-based Performance Management

- ThaiBev has developed guidelines for goal-setting and performance assessment in a systematic and concrete manner. To effectively manage outcomes, ThaiBev has set both financial and business goals as well as other assessment areas. These assessments include:
  1) Improvement of Work Processes, to ensure that employees are able to efficiently improve their performance;
  2) Sustainability, to ensure consistency between long-term goals and business performance;
  3) Personnel Development, to ensure that employees are attentive and capable of transferring knowledge and skills to others within the organization. Such arrangements are aimed at strengthening ThaiBev’s high-performance culture.


# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

- In addition to supporting the implementation of these goals, ThaiBev pays attention to corporate values and behaviors that foster a collaborative culture. When assessing employee performance, ThaiBev has integrated ThaiBev Global Values to promote oneness and create a strong corporate culture to ensure stability and sustainability.

- ThaiBev has developed Beverest, a fully integrated human capital management system, to record and manage employee data, perform human capital processes, and analyze employee data for future human capital strategy planning. It can be accessed through a mobile device for easy monitoring and follow-up between employees and their respective supervisor.

- ThaiBev uses the Balanced Scorecard as a performance management tool to measure the organization’s performance and potential in four areas: Financial Perspective, Customer Perspective, Business Process and Internal Operations Perspective, and Learning and Growth Perspective. It is also used to determine the weight of each goal to cover all of ThaiBev’s important goals.

## Insight

### Noppadon Lertmongkontham
*Sales Representative, Thai Drinks Co., Ltd.*

After the company expanded its coverage of the performance management system, I had the opportunity to use the performance and goal management functions in the Beverest system. I admit that I was not used to the program and the interface at first. However, ThaiBev provides communications in various channels such as video tutorial for each function, and training on how to use the system by the human capital team. This has helped me to understand the system better. I need to use it quite often during the goal-setting period, so I have gradually become more familiar with the system. When I encounter any problems, I can just ask my superior or call the HC Helpdesk, which is like a call center of the human capital group, to assist me. Now that the system is available through a smartphone application it is very convenient for employees as they can use it anywhere and anytime they wish.

### Kanchalikhita Artvichai
*Human Capital Manager, Beer Product Group*

Beverest is a tool that makes it possible to access the structure of the company more clearly. The system shows us where we are in the organization. What really impresses me is that new employees can identify where they are and what team they will work with. I feel that it helps to get a clearer view of the organizational structure. It also helps us to be aware when any KPI that has been set is close to being completed. If, after the performance assessment, we realize that we did not achieve the performance goals, we have to pick ourselves up even more to achieve that goal.


# STORY

**WOW (Way of Work)**  
ThaiBev has integrated WOW (Way of Work) into each employee’s individual KPI. Through performance assessments, which are conducted twice a year, employees are given the opportunity to initiate and exchange ideas with their colleagues and supervisors about how to improve their work, how to make it easier and more efficient, and how to improve business competitiveness. The introduction of WOW received a good response from employees, which led to the establishment of the WOW Awards in 2018.



## Strategy 4: Holistic High Performer Development

To assure its employees an opportunity for limitless growth within the organization, ThaiBev assists employees to fully develop their capabilities through the following two development platforms:

1. **Career Development System**
2. **Talent Development Program**

### 1. Career Development System

- ThaiBev has developed Career Path and Functional Competency to enable employees to plan their future in the organization as well as develop their potential and track progress by using the Individual Development Plan (IDP). This increases opportunities for limitless growth within the organization.

- Within the Individual Development Plan (IDP), ThaiBev uses the principle of developing employees’ potential, according to the 70:20:10 formula.
  - 70 percent is learning by doing, by taking on new responsibilities, special projects and learning through real practice.
  - 20 percent is learning from others, through coaching, being taught by experts, participating in clubs, receiving advice and suggestions, and learning from the executives.
  - 10 percent is learning through formal training, by attending courses, including e-learning or short-term seminars.

- Preparation of an Individual Development Plan (IDP) for any particular job group includes the following steps:
  1. Start out with the Career Path and its corresponding Functional Competencies.
  2. Then assess the Functional Competency to identify any competency gap.
  3. Develop an Individual Development Plan (IDP) based on the results of the assessment, including the career goals identified by employees through Beverest, ThaiBev’s human capital digital platform.

- Individual Development Plan (IDP) were expanded for all job levels in other work groups where supervisors develop the plan through Beverest for effective tracking and monitoring processes.



- **In 2018, the average training hours for employees was 19 hours per person per year.**

I started my sales career with ThaiBev in 2011 as a Cash Van employee, at a time when there was no tablet device to assist us with the sales process. Currently, I am a Customer Management Manager. I have seen changes in ThaiBev, in competitors, and even myself. Since the first day I started working here, I was committed to the idea that "we all work for the organization, everything is possible and we will always go above and beyond the tasks given for career advancement opportunities, along with the development of our knowledge and skills in sales." I consult with my supervisor about the expected goals by using the IDP as a tool to help prioritize what needs to be done and what I need to develop in advance as intended. I am committed to building a strong sales team and delivering success in any location, as it is an important part of achieving the sales goals set by the company.

From the beginning, as an HC Assistant Manager overseeing human capital development at Modern Trade Management Co., Ltd., until now, ThaiBev has given me great opportunities, the latest being an opportunity to support human capital work at SABECO in Vietnam. This is a new type of experience, as I work in a different environment, and with people of different nationalities and cultures. I have always believed that learning by doing is what helps us grow most efficiently. I have discussed with my supervisor how to develop IDPs to fulfill my own potential, in order to prepare to advance in my career path, and to seize the opportunities that the company provides according to our capacities. Working in Vietnam is considered another learning activity through action and consultation with experienced senior staffs will help me be able to develop myself to the next level.


# 2. Talent Development Program

- Employees have access to a variety of development programs to increase business knowledge and promote leadership through 70:20:10 principles and action-learning projects in which ThaiBev employees are given a platform to present their ideas to help the businesses achieve the corporate vision; in this way, senior executives also have the opportunity to see the potential of their employees. It also demonstrates that learning by doing can be more effective than only classroom learning.

- The Talent Development Programs are designed with the purpose of promoting and enhancing employees’ ability to advance in their career under the core principle of learner-centric principle.

- ThaiBev has developed a Leadership Competency Development Guidebook to help employees select a learning activity based on the 70:20:10 principle of capability development. At the same time, the guidebook supports the objective of IDPs.

**Examples**: Supervisory Development Program (SDP), Management Development Program (MDP), ASEAN Management Development (AMD), and the Senior Executive Development Program (SEDP), where senior executives are involved in overseeing and providing feedback to enhance the application of case studies into real practice.

From my experience with the company over the last few years, I am very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to improve and grow, from both my supervisor and the executives, through on-the-job training, participating in development programs, goal-setting and the Individual Development Plan. I have been assigned to oversee various brands, such as Oishi, est, and 100 Plus. Most recently I have been assigned to oversee the overseas markets. These opportunities supported me to learn how to market a variety of brands and to improve my planning skills, negotiation skills, and leadership skills. In addition, I have had the opportunity to attend various development programs, such as the Senior Executive Development Program. It allowed me to learn more about the organization, and gave me the opportunity to work with management in various units.

This demonstrates that he highly values our development within the organization.

# STORY

## Implementation of Initiatives from Talent Development Program

The ThaiBev Catering Program is a direct result of a project presentation by participants in the Management Development Program (MDP) in 2017 and has impressed since then. It is a way for ThaiBev to further grow its businesses by offering food, beverage, and event-organizing as a full-service to meet the needs of customers. As part of the program, a catering business was launched at HoReCa Asia 2017. The catering business has exceeded its sales target, earning profits within the first year of operations. The business has used the principle of “customization, budget control and convenience”, meaning that the services provided must meet customer needs and maximize comfort with the budget available. In addition, as it is a home service for the customers, the business helps promote a Drink No Drive policy and has upgraded its services to business partners by offering a full bar service at various events.


# ThaiBev – NUS Global Executive Leaders Program:  
"Realizing Vision 2020: Strategies for Sustainable ASEAN Leadership"

ThaiBev has collaborated with the National University of Singapore, one of Asia’s top academic institutions, to develop the capabilities of ThaiBev’s executives in the name of the realization of ThaiBev’s Vision 2020 goal to become ASEAN’s stable and sustainable leader in the beverage business. In total, 25 executives throughout ThaiBev participated in this program. One of the action projects from this program that has been adapted and implemented is the Synergy Project, which is based on the concept of shared warehousing between companies within ThaiBev, enabling focus on increasing sales targets and improving service to stores, as well as reducing shipping costs of non-alcoholic products.

The Synergy Project working team selected a warehouse in Maha Sarakham province as a pilot for the sharing project, with the aim to increase sales and distribution in Maha Sarakham province to over 1000 stores, a number which ThaiBev is determined to meet. The program was initiated in August 2018, and the results from August to October show that distribution has increased by 23 percent, stores’ purchase orders have grown by 16.5 percent, and Sermsuk’s sales have risen by 44.5 percent.


# Strategy 5: Proactive Succession and Workforce Planning

ThaiBev has been able to find successors for **93%** of the positions required in the Succession Plan.

- To maintain good corporate governance culture, ThaiBev has developed a Succession Plan that identifies successors for near-retirement senior executives, leading to seamless transitions and enabling business continuity, stability, and sustainability as committed to all stakeholders, customers, and society. Succession planning is carried out as follows:
  1. Identify critical positions.
  2. Identify the appropriate selection criteria for each position, including the leadership characteristics.
  3. Assess the readiness of the executive candidates by adapting the WAR Model as an assessment criteria: Willing, Able, and Ready.
  4. Create Individual Development Plans and monitor regularly.

- ThaiBev has been able to successfully identify candidates for 93 percent of 121 critical positions for which succession plans have been formulated.

## STORY

Fostering and identifying employees that are Willing, Able and Ready to step up and take on important roles in the organization involves the following:

- Systematically process the Talent Assessment, across all job levels and business units, to search the Global Talent Pool for employees who have the potential to grow into leaders of ThaiBev in the future. This task is connected with the continuous creation of Succession Plans.

- Specify Critical Positions in order to create Succession Plans, including selection criteria to evaluate the readiness of individuals for promotion.

- Develop Individual Development Plans and follow-ups to prepare candidates to ascend to Critical Positions through Experiential Learning and the Global Mobility Platform, to enhance their learning curve, further develop their readiness and support ThaiBev’s business expansion abroad.



## WAR Model: Willing, Able & Ready

| Willing | Able | Ready |
|---------|------|-------|
| The employee has the willingness to assume the role. | The employee is knowledgeable, skilled and competent. | The employee is well prepared and available to assume the role. |

Applying WAR Model to assess readiness of the candidates.

## Strategy 6: Strategic Talent Acquisition and Onboarding

Recruitment of personnel with the right capabilities and suitable work experience is one of the top priorities. ThaiBev has created a systematic recruitment and selection process through the various channels:

- **ThaiBev receives job applications** through an online career platform, which shows vacant positions both domestically and internationally, as well as through external job searching websites and other channels, such as the Job Fair, Campus Recruitment and Recruitment Road Shows, organized by public and private universities to reach a wide range of high-potential candidates.

- **Utilizing the Beverest system**, candidates who are interested can easily apply for positions with ThaiBev through the appropriate channels. For example, they can examine all vacant positions and apply by filing personal information and attaching a resume. In addition, an onboarding process for new employees has been established. A welcome message, an introduction to useful links and personnel with whom the new employees will have contact and other basic tools are prepared for the newcomers on their first day.

- **ThaiBev promotes opportunities for internal mobility** through an Internal Recruitment Program that allows employees to apply for jobs via Beverest. A Talent Acquisition team is readily available for consultation on the open positions.

# INSIGHT

### How does participating in the Water Footprint Project and ThaiBev’s Good Water Stewardship benefit society and the environment?

The Water Footprint Project was organized by the Groundwater Resources Department and the Federation of Thai Industries. Water resources used in factories and throughout the supply chain are evaluated, enabling us to identify the processes that use high volumes of water. This data is used to plan appropriately to reduce water usage and create awareness of water usage. It also supports greater sustainability development and improved water stewardship throughout the supply chain, and enables ThaiBev to create greater value and deliver more sustainable returns to society and the environment.

### How does ThaiBev promote sustainability and water stewardship?

Water scarcity has become a more critical issue around the world. ThaiBev is aware of the risk and the impact on communities, therefore ThaiBev implemented a water management system that focuses on both availability and quality of natural water. The aim was to minimize the impact of business operations on the environment and communities. For example:

- Reducing the impact on natural water sources for communities to have water of sufficient quality for their consumption.
- All employees are encouraged to use water efficiently and follow water conservation practices. Internal communication campaigns to promote water conservation have been implemented.
- Using technology to increase the reuse of water according to the principle of the 3Rs, such as the automation of water treatment systems to reduce water usage.
- Cooperating with communities and stakeholders in water usage and water conservation, such as the project of Volunteers to Clean-up the river bank of the Tha Chin River, a cooperative effort between ThaiBev, private companies, local government and communities in order to conserve the Tha Chin River, an important water source.



**Nopwarin Duangdee**  
Assistant Factory Manager, SangSom Co., Ltd.

SangSom Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of ThaiBev, joined the Water Footprint project with the Department of Groundwater Resources and the Federation of Thai Industries, receiving certification on August 3, 2018.

### What is a water footprint?

The water footprint is a measure of water volumes used in production processes, both directly and indirectly, throughout the supply chain. The water footprint is managed for efficient usage of surface water and groundwater, to reduce production costs and increase competitiveness.



# Water Stewardship

Access to clean water is a future challenge for water users, whether producers such as ThaiBev, or communities surrounding the company's factories.

Out of concern for communities and stakeholders who may be impacted by the company’s use of water, ThaiBev has implemented the following water stewardship processes:

## 1. Assessing Water Risks

ThaiBev has initiated a project to assess water risks called the Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA). The project is a collaboration between the company and experts with experience in assessing water sustainability, starting with the Sura Bangyikhan distillery in Pathum Thani. An in-depth assessment of current and possible future water-related risks covers four aspects: water availability, water quality, regulatory changes and stakeholder perceptions:

### Availability and Quality

- Compiling data covering the volume of water withdrawal from various sources; volumes of water discharge; and volumes of water recharge, to analyze the water balance.
- Conducting an on-site survey, including raw water storage ponds, production systems, raw material and chemical storage tanks, and effluent treatment systems, to analyze data for risks to water quantity and quality.
- Surveying communities, nearby factories, and the environment throughout the study area (a radius of 5km around the distillery).
- Studying relevant hydrometeorological hazards concerning water in the atmosphere and natural disasters such as storms, floods, earthquakes or drought.

### Regulatory

- Reviewing applicable water, and wastewater-related regulatory requirements, and continually monitoring the amendment of relevant laws and regulations.

### Stakeholders

- Survey perceptions of the local community, villages, institutions, and local government agencies in the area.
- Study key socio-economic indicators.

Summarize and analyze data to plan for integrated water management that reduces water risks in all dimensions for the distillery, both short term and long term.

Deploy the Global Water Tool developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to assess Water Stress of each factory, using the location of the factories and the volumes of water used by factories.

Make a ledger of water usage volumes, water sources and water reserves, for the company’s water usage to be sustainable, and not impact stakeholders or communities.

## 2. Increase Water Usage Efficiency

Use the water footprint to identify volumes of water usage, starting from raw materials and the production process to finished products. The data will be applicable to an efficient and sustainable water management plan.

Improve production processes to use water efficiently, according to the principle of the 3Rs by reducing water usage, reusing water, and recycling water.

Use the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) system to keep machinery and equipment in good working condition to reduce losses of water and energy in the production process.

## 3. Control Effluent Quality

ThaiBev has effluent treatment systems which are designed to be appropriate for each factory. Quality of effluent is controlled and monitored according to the 2017 Ministry of Industry Announcement concerning standards, and to international standards of environmental management (ISO 14001: 2015). Most importantly, the factory must treat its effluent to be of better quality than required by law before it is released back into public water sources.

### Additional Information

- **Using satellite images** to study the flow of streams, watersheds, slope patterns, and land use within the study area (a radius of 5km around the distillery), including land-use changes over the last 20 years.



# Water Conservation and Water Replenishment

ThaiBev supports internal and external agencies to organize various activities and projects to promote the conservation of water and headwaters, as well as water replenishment.

- **ThaiBev Helps Build a Model District for Good Living**  
  in Bua Yai, Nan Province. This project aims to manage headwaters in an area of organic agriculture on 1 rai of land. The target is to replenish the forested watersheds of Nan province. ThaiBev joined with the community to develop a hydraulic ram to pump water to a higher level, and then build check dams for agricultural irrigation to make the community self-reliant. A mountain water supply was also developed. The project stimulated a change from monoculture to integrated agriculture.

- **ThaiBev Engages in Forest Conservation with the Huay Hong Krai Royal Development Study Center to Improve Quality of Life**  
  in Nam Pang, Nan Province. Check dams were constructed to conserve headwaters and protect ecosystems to conserve the watershed in Nan Province.

- **Nateechai-Kaeng Krung Relationship**  
  - Jointly building check dams in Kaeng Krung National Park, Viphavadee district, Surat Thani Province, to conserve headwaters and protect ecosystems.

- **Love Water, Love Forest, Conserve the Land – Volunteers Plant Trees to Conserve Water**  
  Staff of Mongkolsamai Co., Ltd. joined a tree-planting activity with the Uttaradit Provincial Administration Organization and Pha Juk district TAO in Being Mai, Ban Dan, Mae Khaman, Lab-lae, Uttaradit Province, to help rehabilitate the forest and watershed.

- **Volunteers to Clean the Canals Connected to the Tha Chin River and Clean Canals Project**  
  This project is a cooperative effort between ThaiBev, private companies, local government, and communities, to clean water hyacinth and other weeds from the canals connected to Tha Chin River and Klong Chedi Bucha in Nakhon Pathom, and Klong Saen Sab in Samut Sakhon. These are important water sources for local communities around the factories. The cleanup helps water flows, and prevents damage to property and agricultural land during the rainy season, reduces stagnant water, and beautifies the canals and river.

- **Improving Water Supplies**  
  for the communities of Ban Khok Kong and Ban Dong Yai Pao in Buriram Province. ThaiBev improved water-pumping systems, power systems, and drinking water systems, and took water samples for quality analysis, as well as giving advice to community water producers, so that water supplies for the community around the factory meets health standards.

| 2018 | 0.22                          |

ThaiBev has plans to expand its Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA) to manage water risks in all dimensions for all factories. The Groundwater Sustainability Assessment (GSA) at the Beer Thip Brewery (1991) Co., Ltd. in Ayutthaya Province will be completed by November 2018. In succeeding years, it is expected that the assessments will be expanded to every factory within the spirit, beer, and non-alcoholic beverage product groups, as well as the food business.

ThaiBev is inviting its suppliers to join the Water Footprint Project, particularly sugar mills, with at least one sugar producer to be completed in 2019. There are plans to invite other key suppliers, such as bottle manufacturers, in subsequent years, for integrated water stewardship throughout the supply chain.



# Waste Management

ThaiBev has implemented a Waste Hierarchy system and applied the principle of the Circular Economy, emphasizing reuse and redistribution, or re-manufacturing and recycling, to prevent and mitigate impacts to the environment and communities, in the following ways:

- **Designing packaging and managing post-consumption packaging** to reduce the use of natural resources while retaining quality and strength. For instance, plastic bottles are designed to use less plastic, while glass bottles and corrugated carton partitions can be recycled in the beverage manufacturing process.

- **Training and engaging employees** to reduce and prevent waste by using the tools of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM).

- **Increasing the value of waste or by-products** by using them as raw materials in the agricultural and industrial sectors to further reinforce a reduction in the use of chemicals. For example, using malt residue and grain residue from alcohol production as ingredients in livestock feed; or using effluent from the vinasse treatment process as a soil conditioner in the growing of crops such as sugarcane, rice, cassava and oil palm.

- **Using beverage manufacturing waste to generate renewable energy.** For instance, vinasse, a waste by-product from the distilling process, and wastewater from beer brewing, are used to produce biogas. Furthermore, vinasse has been evaporated and developed into biomass fuel, which is used to generate heat and electricity.




# Insight

**Pramot Somchaiyanon**  
Managing Director, Thai Beverage Energy Co., Ltd.

Thai Beverage Energy Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of ThaiBev PLC, has the core responsibility of using waste from alcohol production to produce energy (Waste to Energy). This has resulted in Thai Beverage Energy’s Buriram branch winning an Excellence Award for Renewable Energy (Co-generation Project) at the Thailand Energy Awards 2018.

## What is the Thailand Energy Awards?

The Thailand Energy Awards is a project established by the government and private sector to measure the success of projects focused on developing alternative sources of energy and energy efficiency, assessing them with the criteria of environmental management, social responsibility, expandability and potential implementation.

## Which ThaiBev project received an award, and what is the achievement?

The vinasse renewable energy project of Thai Beverage Energy’s Buriram branch won the award for excellence in renewable energy, in the category of co-generation. Biogas is produced by treating vinasse to replace fossil fuels to generate steam and electricity. It can replace fuel oil in the production of spirits, enough to generate surplus electricity that is sold to the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).

## After winning the award, does the company have any plans to convert more waste into energy in the future?

ThaiBev has a plan to expand its renewable energy generation to every factory in order to treat waste from production, conserve the environment, and create sustainability and energy security for the company, as energy is another key indispensable factor for the industry.

## Benefits of the Program

- Promotes sustainability and energy security
- Reduces the consumption of fossil fuels
- Increases the proportion of renewable energy in Thailand
- Reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80,000 tons of CO₂e / year*
- Solves the problem of strong odors from vinasse by using a closed system for treatment
- Farmers can use effluent from vinasse treatment as a soil conditioner
- Increases employment opportunities for the local community

*Note: Refers to T-VER project of voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction in Thailand

# Reducing Waste and the Use of Plastic in Everyday Life

ThaiBev has ongoing initiatives to support the reduction of waste and plastic in everyday life:

- **Waste bank, waste separation, and participation in waste management campaigns** promote the reduction and separation of waste at the point of use, thus adding value to waste before it is properly disposed of. This is expected to reduce waste by 600kg/site/year.

- **Converting food waste to fertilizer** reduces waste and impacts on the environment. This project is expected to reduce waste by 1.8 tons/site/year.

- **A project to reduce and/or end the use of plastic bags and foam boxes**, offers points collection in exchange for using cloth bags, bringing one’s own glass. The purpose is to stimulate a reduction in the use of single-use plastic and encourage the use of materials that are more environmentally friendly.

# Waste-to-Energy

ThaiBev treats waste from production processes and converts it to energy in two ways:

1. **Energy from biogas**, a by-product of beverage production.  
   It can be used to substitute energy from fossil fuels and produce less GHG emissions. This reduces the company’s fuel costs: in 2018, the company was able to replace the use of fuel oil by 19.26 million liters, equal to a savings of 306.85 million baht.

2. **Energy from biomass**: ThaiBev has a factory that produces alternative energy from vinasse in Kanchanaburi Province. The co-generation system can produce both electricity and heat from concentrated vinasse. This project started selling electricity to the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) on September 11, 2018, and is expected to produce heat energy in the form of steam for use in the production of spirits at the rate of 60 tons per hour, and electricity for the PEA at a maximum rate of 7.5 MW/h.

# Moving Forward

Despite measures to minimize the amount of waste sent to landfills, it is not possible to entirely avoid generating waste and still maintain quality and consumer safety. Therefore, to operate the business with responsibility to communities, society, and the environment, ThaiBev must have waste treatment and disposal methods in compliance with laws and regulations. The following are success stories from 2018:

- Reduced the use of resources in main packaging materials by a total of 598,199 tons.
- In the beverage business, as much as 88.63 percent of all waste from the production process (12,677 tons) can be value-added (reused / recycled / energy recovered).
- In the food business, as much as 44.08 percent of all waste from the production process (796 tons) can be value-added (reused / recycled / energy recovered).

  In 2019, ThaiBev will construct two more biogas plants to process vinasse at distilleries in Nong Khai and Nakhon Sawan Provinces. Public hearings have been held and risk analysis reports have been prepared for the two locations, and it is expected that both sites can produce biogas to replace fuel oil for the distilleries in 2020. This will help reduce GHG emissions by 30,000 tons at each site every year. Also, there will be a pilot project to generate electricity from solar cells at breweries and factories producing green tea.


# Eco-Friendly Packaging

- Glass, paper, aluminum, and plastic are the main packaging materials used in producing spirits, beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and food.

- When developing packaging, ThaiBev considers environmental factors by using the 3Rs principle, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, to reduce long-term impacts on the environment and society.

- ThaiBev has collaborated with public and private sectors, as well as local communities, in many projects and activities to promote cooperation to tackle packaging waste and pollution.

## Insight

**Sinchai Thiensiri**  
Director, Thailand Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE)

The various kinds of used packaging are raw materials. If we separate packaging after consumption, the packaging can be used as a raw material in production.

Both the public and private sectors must take part in encouraging consumers to be aware and take responsibility for the results of their own consumption, and to increase channels for consumers to have a role in adjusting their behavior to promote a society of sustainable consumption at the national level.


# Management of the Main Packaging Materials

ThaiBev endeavors to return post-consumption packaging to the manufacturing process and our supply chain by emphasizing cooperation and participation amongst all groups of stakeholders, including the parent company, suppliers, retailers, and consumers, to reduce the environmental impact of packaging waste. ThaiBev adheres to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal No. 12 (UN SDG 12) as a guiding principle in establishing sustainable production and consumption, and to reduce waste, especially for ThaiBev’s main packaging materials, with an emphasis on the 3Rs principle.

# Insight

## How important is climate change to ThaiBev?

The climate change crisis, which is becoming more intense, is causing impacts on natural resources and energy. ThaiBev is aware of the importance of climate change; as a large producer of beverages using water and agricultural products as its main raw materials, it is directly impacted. There are also energy limitations from using natural resources and future risks such as a Carbon Tax on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the company's operation.

## How does ThaiBev evaluate the risks from climate change to avoid impacts on business operations?

ThaiBev manages risks from the environment and climate change through supervision of the company’s Sustainability and Risk Management Committee. This team is comprised of directors, senior management and the company’s independent directors, who are tasked with sustainability and risk policy. They monitor possible impacts to the company from climate change and plan risk management actions to mitigate those impacts.

## What does the company do to reduce the impact of climate change?

ThaiBev encourages investment in development of renewable energy projects to reduce impacts from climate change, such as installing a solar rooftop, or generating steam from biogas from the waste treatment process and regularly monitoring these projects. ThaiBev joined the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (a public organization) for greenhouse gas assessment through the Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP) and the Carbon Footprint for Organization (CFO). This organization is a center for information and operations, as well as a consultant to state and private bodies on managing greenhouse gases. ThaiBev is also engaged in a pilot project to assess its water footprint with the Department of Groundwater Resources and the Federation of Thai Industries.

# Renewable Energy

ThaiBev strives to reduce the impacts from climate change throughout the Value Chain by using alternative energy technologies, as well as promoting the following initiatives to reduce the use of energy and resources:

- Establishing a provincial distribution center which was designed to be environmentally responsible with the installation of solar rooftops. The lighting at this center is 50 percent from solar power.

- Installing solar cells at breweries at a cost of 105 million baht to generate electricity equivalent to 1.3m kw/h. Installation of solar cells for all the breweries will be implemented from 2019 to 2021.

- Installing solar tubes to make hot water in conjunction with using recovered wasted heat from the compressed air system for the purpose of increasing water temperature before feeding into the boiler system. The process can reduce fuel consumption for steam production.

- Installing biomass production facilities that use by-products of the production process, such as distillery vinasse to produce renewable thermal energy for the distillation process. Surplus energy is used to generate power that is sold to the Provincial Electricity Authority.

- Installing anaerobic waste treatment systems to reduce electrical energy usage; biogas produced from the system can be used to replace fuel oil in steam production.

# Carbon Footprint

Carbon footprint means the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the company's activities (Carbon Footprint for Organization), or the amount of greenhouse gases emitted throughout the product life-cycle – from raw material-sourcing to the production, transportation, consumption and management of post-consumption materials (Carbon Footprint of Product) with units represented in terms of tons CO₂e.

ThaiBev encourages reducing greenhouse gas emissions efficiently by certifying the Carbon Footprint of Product and Carbon Footprint for Organization with the Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (a public organization). This gives ThaiBev an accurate database to measure its greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of identifying the sources of greenhouse gas emissions and initiating a carbon offsetting plan. This enables ThaiBev to mitigate climate change.

# Creating and Sharing for Sustainable Growth

To achieve its social responsibility policies, ThaiBev supports its directors and employees to undertake volunteer activities and public charity in all forms, and arranges many bodies or working groups to pursue various community development projects. These efforts are divided into two parts which are:

1) **At Corporate Level**, these comprise the department of Community Development Programs; the group of enhancing quality of life and the environment; external affairs group; Thai Talent project group; the group supporting art and culture; the group from Human Resources; and the group from Corporate Communications.

2) **At Local Level**, around a factory; these comprise public relations and environmental groups in each factory, which work in coordination with the corporate level. Each agency coordinates and operates projects it has initiated, or in cooperation with various groups in society.

Community development programs from both parts enable every area featuring ThaiBev operations to respond to needs and reduce various impacts which may arise in the community. ThaiBev covers its stakeholder groups 100 percent.

In initiating projects and activities to benefit local communities, society and the environment, covering all areas in which it operates, ThaiBev abides by the following operating procedures:

- It regularly assesses social and environmental impacts by creating relationships and inquiring about the opinions or needs of the target community, including those in the area around the factory, around facility or communities close to the company's products. This is done using questionnaires, through interviews and public meetings, and by communicating with community leaders, parents’ groups, school boards or through small weekly informal meetings.

- Based on the opinions of the target community, social activities are created to cover 5 main categories: Developing communities and society; Education; Public health; Sports; or Art and Culture. The objective is to meet the needs of the community, including all genders and age groups, minorities, the under privileged and those people who live in remote areas.

- Every project must have concrete measures to assess the results; by evaluating the satisfaction of the community and stakeholders, social and environmental impacts, and follow up reports from the relevant bodies such as government agencies, universities and civil society groups.


# Example of the Participation Process with Stakeholder Groups

## Understanding Needs
- Identify stakeholders
- Design format of participation
- Summarize needs

## Conducting Project Management

### How are social activities designed so that they can create sustainability for the community?

ThaiBev believes that step-by-step business growth is not enough. Growth is only successful when the company shares value with society. For this reason, the President and CEO, Mr. Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, suggested establishing the department of "Community Development Programs", which is the important starting point of sustainable development. Under the project name "A Good Community with Smile", the idea is to strengthen communities and create a local model, which offers strong mutual support between the local community and the business. The goal is to help people alleviate their expenses and increase their income, without any negative impacts on themselves, others or the environment.

### How do you create participatory working formats between ThaiBev and communities?

By building strength within the communities and improving the quality of life in every aspect, leading to economic security for the community, together with building good relations between the company and the communities, by cooperating with communities in thinking and developing knowledge together. Meanwhile, all parties are encouraged to participate to work together sustainably. This leads to stronger local connections and better understanding of the company, which in turn leads to reduction or prevention of conflict between the community and the company in the future.

### Results expected from Community Development Programs

We believe that building strength in this form will lead to concrete results for the community in economic, social and environmental terms, resulting in increased income for its members, the formation of groups as community enterprises, water management systems for community agriculture and green space from reviving the forest. When there is a healthy economy, the community itself can share the value of growth by extending their knowledge and methods to nearby communities. This spreads sustainability at the local level and leads to genuine development of economic systems at the national level.


# ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold Year 19

Giving assistance and supporting government operations to help people affected by cold weather, ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold Year 19 continues to bring 200,000 green blankets each year to areas affected by the cold in 15 provinces of North and Northeast Thailand. These blankets are also a symbol of warmth every year. A large number of people living in remote areas of Thailand still lack sufficient warm clothing or blankets, particularly those people living on high mountains off remote roads that are difficult to access. ThaiBev joined with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of the Interior Ministry to compile data on populations affected by the cold and the numbers affected in every province. Then blankets are transported to the area for distribution to the people every November before the cold actually arrives. Over the past 19 years, 3.8 million blankets have been offered to cold victims in 45 provinces, 578 districts.

Apart from blankets, other types of assistance are offered, through cooperation from partners in many sectors. This assistance includes health checkups from mobile medical teams, music, sport and art programs for the local children and the donation of educational equipment and scholarships to schools which are in need.



**Thongchai Khunaprom**  
Administrator of Ban Sai Thai 4 Tai School, Ban Kruad, Buriram

We are extremely happy that ThaiBev held this program of offering blankets to local people in this community. I am impressed that ThaiBev sees the importance of the people in this community. I’d like to thank ThaiBev who are a part of giving to our community, and I’d like to see this kind of good program on future occasions. Thanks also to ThaiBev for giving educational equipment to the children. The kids thank you very much.


# A Good Community with Smiles

This project has been running since 2012 with the objective of creating a better quality of life in every aspect for the communities surrounding company factories. There is a special emphasis on developing the knowledge and abilities of those young people in the community who lack opportunities. The project focuses on teaching skills in three areas to young people for a day.

- **Sports**: Together with the Chang Mobile Football Unit, trainers are brought in to provide knowledge and training in basic skills, same as in a professional training set up. Public figures from many organizations rotate in joining these activities, such as the Volleyball Association of Thailand or famous football clubs in every province. Besides giving instruction in basic sports techniques, the sessions also teach kids about sportsmanship — useful skills that they can apply to their daily lives.

- **Music**: With the cooperation of the Sukree Charoensuk Foundation, musical experts train children who are interested in the basic techniques of singing and playing musical instruments, or who wish to enhance their skills in bands and orchestras. They are taught according to international standards with the emphasis on songs used in everyday life such as the National Anthem. Besides this, youngsters that demonstrate musical talent are provided advice on how they might further develop their skills in the future.

- **Art**: This activity teaches the creation of practical art through the use of leftover objects thereby encouraging creative thinking, and inspiring new creations that might even lead to income for the students and the community.

For over 7 years, “A Good Community with Smiles” has helped hone skills and provide creative inspiration for children in communities surrounding 21 of ThaiBev’s factories; covering 61 provinces of Thailand.



**Nick, Saksit Sinsorn**  
P4 student at Neung Wat Lamai Municipal School

I already love art, so the teacher encouraged me to join this activity. It wasn’t really difficult. I gained knowledge, new friends, and concentration. I like silk cocoons which are a natural product in the community. We don’t have to invest much and we can make nice key rings to hang off our bags, which can even make income for me and my friends.

# ThaiBev helps Create a Model Ethical Career Community, Bua Yai sub-district, Nan Province

The community of Bua Yai sub-district, Na Noi district, Nan province faces the challenge of effectively managing its water for highland agriculture. Bua Yai community has a total of 214 headwater streams, but only 4 of them flow all year, leading local farmers to focus on monoculture, which requires only a small amount of water. Over a long period, this has resulted in a chain of different negative impacts.

Through the dedication of the community and the support of the business sector and allied organizations, a solution was found. It is based on the concept of "managing headwater streams in an area of integrated agriculture, to extend and expand on 1 rai of organic agriculture, with a target of reviving the Nan watershed". This was the starting point for completely changing the way of life of the community.

However, another challenging problem was how to bring water up to the growing area which was located on a high mountain. ThaiBev joined with the community to develop a "hydraulic ram" system at a high altitude and to build check dams in three places to store water for agriculture. Alongside this, the community made rules regulating the use of the water and also the water fund. The fund was allocated for repairs in the case of damage, so the community would not be reliant on the government’s budget. Besides this, they also jointly developed a water supply on the mountain that was 9,622 metres long, with a total usable area of 1,000 rai.

## Achievements in Water Management

In solving the problem of water management for highland agriculture, the achievements can be listed as follows:

- **Hydraulic ram system**: 11 points, benefitting 11 rai of land
- **Check dam system**: 8 dams, benefitting 24 rai of land
- **Water supply system**: length of 9,622 metres servicing 1,000 rai of land
- **Members benefitting**: 35 people, with volume of water of 15 tanks (1,178.1 liters/tank), equal to a total of 17,671.5 liters (17.67 cubic meters)

## Achievements in Agriculture Conversion

In converting from monoculture to integrated agriculture, the achievements were as follows:

- **34 growers** on 36 plots in an area of 146.1 rai in Bua Yai sub-district converted to organic agriculture under a system of participatory certification
- A group of organic growers was set up in Bua Yai with 163 members covering an area of 815 rai; they were encouraged to grow three new crops and get the benefit from four overall crops, thus replacing their dependence on monoculture. These crops could also be planted daily, monthly or yearly. They were encouraged to grow organic pumpkin (during the transition period) of indigenous strains Khang Khok and Khai Nao; these were grown by 50 farmers.
- **Increased income** for the community by increasing distribution channels for organic produce in modern trade stores, such as organic pumpkin (during the transition period), with a total income of 300,000 Baht in 2018.

# The Project of Hearts on Forestation under The King Initiatives

Erosion along a 4.7-km coastline in Bangkhunthien led to the loss of over 3,000 rai of land, directly impacting the people who live there and forcing them to migrate about 1.3 km inland from the original marker. To help create a sustainable solution and return social, economic and environmental benefits to the community, ThaiBev joined the Foundation of Hearts on Forestation under The King Initiatives to support the planting of mangroves on an area of 50 rai (at a value of 12 million baht). The purchase of 40,000 mangrove saplings suitable for planting in the 50 rai area on the Bangkhunthien coastline, as well as the need for them to be tended to for a period of 3 years, has created employment for the community.

## Results

- Area of mangroves increased by 50 rai of land
- An additional 40,000 trees which are of benefit to the coastal eco-system and the conservation of over 70 species of marine life
- Increased income for the communities of Bangkhunthien derived from the planting and caring for the trees for 3 years

The starting point of the project was to solve the problem of coastal erosion. Through the cooperation between various agencies and the communities of Bangkhunthien there have been additional benefits, including the development of a new eco-tourism attraction in Bangkok, which should make for an improved and sustainable local economy in the future.

Before we made the hydraulic ram, I used to make a siphon, but failed. After we received knowledge and support from ThaiBev and learned how to bring the water up high, we tried making a hydraulic ram, and it worked really well. Now we can pump water up and store it in tanks and feed water to anywhere on the plot. Another 5 households use the water together.


# Program of Cooperation between the Huai Hong Khrai Centre and ThaiBev to Revive the Forest and Improve Quality of Life in Ban Nam Poon, Nam Phang District and Ban Sri Na Pan, Reuang District, Nan Province

To help protect headwaters, preserve the forest and improve local residents’ quality of life, ThaiBev collaborated with the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Centre of HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on the occasion of Her Royal Highness’ 5th Cycle Anniversary on 2 April, 2015 bringing the proven successful strategy of Royal development implemented in Chiang Mai by the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Centre at Doi Saket as a model to be adjusted and applied to Nan province. The goal was to revive the watershed and help villagers become self-reliant with sustainable economic and environmental practices. The target areas of the program were two villages: Ban Nam Poon and Ban Sri Na Pan. The Huai Hong Khrai Centre shared sustainable development practices with the two villages; the project was intended to create a learning centre for other communities.

In 2017, 150 residents from the two target communities received training and were supplied with raw materials for rearing livestock and crops for daily consumption, in order to reduce household expenses. The idea was that livestock not needed for villagers’ consumption could yield high-quality products that could be sold by farmers. In 2018, follow-up studies found that these two communities saw their incomes increase by 150–220 percent by raising livestock.

Local communities in the target areas live in reserved forests, where there has been massive encroachment for many generations. In its present state, the area is a bald mountain-top. Once the government took firm control, the villagers had no way to make a living. ThaiBev’s urgent obligation is how to make the community self-reliant for food and protein and to survive sustainably. I took the community on a field trip to see the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Centre of HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn in Doi Saket, Chiang Mai. They had the opportunity to tour the Centre and decided on what interested them, and what they were good at. Some wanted to raise pigs, catfish, frogs, egg-laying chickens or Bhutanese phoenix mushrooms. We were ready to support the project with supplies and fund it for a five-year period. Many community members have received further support as model growers. Soon we may have a learning centre for studying the Sufficiency Economy in this area. We are proud to give communities the opportunity to learn royally-approved methods of sustainable development, and to help them increase their income while reducing household expenses.

I’ve known about this project since 2015, and I am happy that anything we want to eat is there to eat, and they will provide anything that we want to raise. From the beginning, the ThaiBev team took us to the Huai Hong Khrai Centre in Doi Saket, Chiang Mai. We learned the correct ways to raise pigs, fish and egg-laying chickens. I started raising pigs the way that they had taught. Now I can breed my own pigs and get at least ten from every litter, so I can sell them for a good price. I no longer plant corn and use chemicals.


# Sermsuk PCL’s Occupational Training Project

Sermsuk PCL’s Occupational Training Project Taught Disabled People and their Caregivers to Raise Egg-laying Chickens, Plant Hydroponic Crops and Grow Mushrooms for Market.

From 2016 to 2018, Sermsuk PCL organized the "Occupational Training Project to raise egg-laying hens, plant hydroponic crops and grow mushrooms for market for disabled people and their caregivers." The program applied agricultural technology and knowledge in conjunction with existing local resources for disabled members of the community to make a living. The disabled and their caregivers were shown how to raise hens, build sheds and install equipment for egg production, as well as how to grow mushrooms and other hydroponic crops. The objective was for the disabled to generate an income for their families, reduce household expenses and live with greater self-esteem in their community.

More than 100 disabled people and their caregivers received training from the program. They obtained healthy livestock and supplies for household consumption and for the market. By raising egg-laying hens, the disabled villagers managed to generate an average monthly income of 2,178 baht. Hydroponic crops and mushroom cultivation generated an average monthly income of 1,830 baht.

## Moving Forward

In order to establish greater self-reliance and sustainability, ThaiBev supported the community with various projects and activities:

1. **One Tambon One Good Occupation Project** was emphasised and expanded to create model projects around the factories and other areas, with the aim of increasing communities’ income by at least 10 percent by 2019.

2. **Good Community with Smiles Project**
   - To protect the natural resources and environment, the area of the project was expanded to new areas and extended to include water management and provide more green space for the community in at least two additional locations.

- To boost the involvement of young people, the number of children and youngsters included in occupational training and life skills programs will increase by 10% in 2019.

3. A project with Huai Hong Khrai Center to expand royally-inspired knowledge spread out to the six Royal Development Study Centres to assist selected villagers in Petchaburi, Chachoengsao, Chantaburi, Sakon Nakhon, Chiang Mai, and Narathiwat.

Managing Director,  
Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd.

The Pracharath Rak Samakkee (PRS) Social Enterprise Network is a new space to create cooperation in Thai society that combines forces from all sectors to participate in rural community development to help reduce inequality in society. The PRS Network was established with a clear intention to nurture sustainability and cooperation.

Since the project started in 2016, more than 15 large private companies have joined the initiative to invest and work on various projects with educational institutions, state agencies, and many civil society groups. A new format of working methods is being established for the next generation. We have set up a project, "Collaboration for Our Hometowns," to find and train 150 people interested in sustainable community development in their home towns. In 2018 we selected 13 candidates, with excellent performance records, to set up and manage social enterprises at the district level.

# STORY

The government’s Pracharath policy aims to coordinate cooperation with all sectors, to solve problems and find ways to build a better future for Thailand. ThaiBev has become head of the Private Sector Working Group, in the Working Group of the Local Economic Development Pracharath Policy. This group has the key target of creating new income for communities in order to improve their quality of life. The work is completed through the combined efforts of five sectors, which are the government sector, the private sector, the civil society sector, the academic sector and the general public. Together, they drive local economies to develop a whole system from upstream to midstream to downstream, with the emphasis on 3 areas – Agriculture, Processing and Community-based Tourism – and they strive to build a network of PRS social enterprise companies that extends all over the country.

To drive the work efficiently and to achieve concrete results as well as long-term continuity, the Working Group has established social enterprises under the name Pracharath Rak Sammākī or PRS in every province, and has established PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. as a coordinating entity between the various sectors around the country. All of the 77 PRS social enterprise companies were established in 2016.

Throughout 2018, 76 PRS Social Enterprise companies developed community businesses around the country via 428 projects in 3 groups – Agriculture (29%), Processing (52%) and Community-based Tourism (19%) – creating community income for 35,346 households worth over 172 million baht.

# Creatively Developing Community Products

In 2018, PRS, with the support of ThaiBev, launched projects to develop community products. The aim is to upgrade product design and quality to meet international standards and meet the needs of modern consumers.

- **Thai Handicraft Pakaoma Project** focuses on creating added value in four ways: raising awareness and interest in hand-woven "pakaoma" in both domestic and foreign markets; encouraging innovations in production and processing of hand-woven pakaoma to enable a greater range of uses; sharing knowledge between communities and experts in various fields such as the use of natural dyes and packaging; and the protection of intellectual property rights by copyrighting community designs, with trademarks and patents. In 2018 the project held three activities generating over 30 million baht for pakaoma producers nationwide.

# Sustainability Report 2018

- **A practical seminar** for more than 400 pakaoma weaving communities from across Thailand to develop production techniques and business management, enabling producers to network with each other and collaborate more effectively.

- **Empower the young generation** by stimulating interest in weaving and design. Pakaoma products have been supported by two main initiatives: 
  - **"Finding the heirs of Thai Pakaoma,"** a program that trains young people from pakaoma-producing and weaving communities to carry on the trade in 15 locations around the country.
  - **"Nava-atalak"** (innovative identity) design contest, in which contestants entered 260 pieces in three contest categories: fashion, home textiles and patterns.

- **Connecting to markets** and publicizing hand-woven pakaoma community products in new markets through collaborations with leading designers, making booths and fashion catalogs, etc.

- **Sapai Sainaew Project (Local cloth for bags and straps):** Helping young people in the upper North (Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phrae, Nan, Lampang, and Lamphun provinces) add value to their unique local cloth, distinct to their district. This project was supported by the Thailand Textile Institute (THTI), along with local and national designers, to design and develop “Yaam” shoulder bags with various local cloths to reflect a diverse range of ethnicities. ThaiBev helps to bring the products to new markets, by supporting various media productions and teaching villagers how to sell their products online. This project has generated income for 959 participating members of the community with a total value of 2 million baht in just five months since the start of the program.

# Connecting Community Products to New Markets

PRS Social Enterprise has created new distribution channels for community products with the following projects:

- **Hospital Food Safety Project**: PRS Social Enterprise has signed an MOU with the Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, and the Community Organizations Development Institute (a public organization) to encourage the production and consumption of safe food by linking producers of safe fruits and vegetables and organic foodstuffs with hospitals nationwide under the Ministry of Public Health. The PRS social enterprises in each province will be responsible for making production plans and developing standards for community farmers, as well as coordinating the sale and delivery of produce to provincial hospitals. In 2018, communities from 20 provinces in the PRS network joined the project and earned 15 million baht.

- **Creating online sales channels**: PRS Social Enterprise has connected with leading telecommunications and online marketing companies to create outlets and develop online sales methods for local communities through the Farm Suk app and the Lazada online marketplace. Catalogs of community products are displayed on the company's online communication channels, bringing 400 SKUs of products online from 112 communities in 53 provinces around the country.

- **Cheunjai Thailand TV Program**: ThaiBev has joined PRS Social Enterprise and Amarin Television to more widely promote Community-based Tourism through the Cheunjai Thailand TV Program. The tourism documentary program, broadcast on the Amarin TV HD channel 34, first aired in 2016. The content covers 94 communities in 62 provinces. The publicity generated by the program and other activities has generated income of more than 30 million baht for local communities.

- **Making connections between provinces**: This networking initiative aims to facilitate exchanges, find outlets for overstocked goods, and solve the problem of production surpluses through cooperation between PRS social enterprises in each province. In 2018, markets were found for pineapples from Lampang, Phetchabun, Ratchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan provinces; garlic from Mae Hong Son province, longan from Nan province; fresh chilies from Phatthalung province; and lychees from Samut Songkhram province. Efforts have also been made to find shelf space for community products at modern trade stores in various provinces. Through these efforts in 2018, PRS Social Enterprise and its network found new marketing outlets that generated additional income of 30 million baht.


# Disseminating Knowledge

- **Technology Outreach to Cure Poverty** (Using Science to Help the Poor): ThaiBev and PRS Social Enterprise have joined the Ministry of Science and Technology to distribute ready-to-use technology directly into outlying communities through various media channels such as online channels, websites, and training programs. An emphasis has been placed on upgrading local products and reducing production costs on OTOP Grade C and D products in 10 lower-income provinces: Mae Hong Son, Kalasin, Buriram, Nan, Nakhon Phanom, Narathiwat, Pattani, Chainat, Tak, and Amnat Charoen.

- **Diplomatic efforts**: PRS Social Enterprise representatives attended the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2017 (HLPF) at the United Nations headquarters in New York, where the private sector team was led by Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, director of the Pracharath Local Economic Development (E3), to propose the Voluntary National Reviews for the development of local economies and PRS to promote the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), joining all sectors in society under the PRS umbrella, and making it better known internationally.

# Moving Forward

ThaiBev and PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. will continue to support the Thai Handicraft Pakaoma Project, Collaboration for Our Hometowns, or Project of safe food at hospitals, as well as other projects. To ensure seamless cooperation in rural community development between all sectors in the PRS Social Enterprise network, ThaiBev has outlined the following plans for future projects:

- To study its various projects around the country by analyzing the results, identifying factors for success, and risks, to form a foundation of knowledge to help future initiatives reach their goals and continue their outreach efforts.

- ThaiBev has established the Foundation for Developing Social Enterprises of Thailand to connect various social enterprises in the PRS network and other networks, enabling them to more effectively collaborate, as well as to share knowledge that is useful for the work of social enterprises at the national and international level.

ThaiBev hopes that everyone will be able to develop their potential for themselves, the society, and the nation.

## Story: Scholarship Fund for Children of Employees

Since 2010, ThaiBev has been managing a scholarship fund to promote and support educational advancement for children of employees who have strong academic records, as well as to help alleviate costs for their parents. From 2010 to 2018, 9,243 scholarships have been granted, a total of 57,198,000 baht.

In 2018, the children of employees received 1,075 scholarships, totalling 6,670,000 baht. The scholarships were granted in two separate programs: 1,065 scholarships for general education, and 10 special scholarships (White Elephant) were granted, from elementary school level to higher education. Among ThaiBev scholarship recipients, 23 children have received support for nine consecutive years. Since 2010, 40 students who received scholarships from the programs have joined the ThaiBev workforce.

ThaiBev continues to be committed to sponsoring the education of children of employees, so that they grow into strong and dependable adults with a solid educational foundation.

# Leadership for Sustainable Education Development (Connext ED)

ThaiBev joined the Ministry of Education and 12 private sector businesses for Pracharath Policy’s Basic Education and Leadership Development Project for students to experiment with business practices, so they are able to manage and realize the value of money. They are encouraged to learn about household accounting, costs and profits. This will help them understand basic business through a “child-centered” learning process.

The project has been coordinated for second years with 27 partner universities, educating 76,325 students from 292 schools in 47 provinces. Money management and basic business service skills are covered. Interested students can further develop their knowledge by further participating in the project. There are 292 business project trials under the supervision and guidance of experts from partner universities, with the slogan of “Help the Young”. ThaiBev provides initial funding for the business projects. Students are encouraged to apply their knowledge and skills to real life experiences, taking on the role of entrepreneur. In addition, the company has cooperated with the Department of Community Development to launch a scholarship competition – the 2nd OTOP JUNIOR contest has awarded more than 500,000 baht to scholarship winners.

The project promotes the knowledge needed for accounting and business, and develops leadership and teamwork skills that benefit students in their daily lives and future careers.

Through the project we have learned about accounting, profit and loss statements, and income. The notes we take every time after we make Thong Muan coconut crispy rolls has helped us more clearly see the profits we make. So we can save the money we earn in our own piggy bank and take it out when we want to spend some money. This helps us learn about how difficult it is for our parents to make a living, and that if we do not work on our own and make money on our own, our parents must work harder and become more tired to earn money for us. We are glad and proud to be able to make money while studying.

# Opportunities for Special Children

ThaiBev has supported 7 schools for children with special needs in 6 provinces, including Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Nakhon Sawan, Phitsanulok, Ubon Ratchathani, and Songkhla, to provide education to children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities. ThaiBev’s working group and partner universities in the area act as consultants and project facilitators.

In addition, ThaiBev has also donated money to support the "Low-relief Art from Recycled Paper" project and has brought the pieces to distribute at cooperatives. The project aims to educate children, improve their concentration, and develop their fine motor skills. The project also helps them develop their emotions so they can focus on what they are doing for longer periods and are better able to make decisions on their own.

*Students with special needs at Kawila Anukul School, Wat Ket Sub-district, Muang District, Chiang Mai Province, are making low-relief art from recycled paper.*

# Mulberry Leaf Tea Project, Ban Nong Kradon School, Nakhon Pathom Province

ThaiBev has collaborated with the Faculty of Management Sciences at Nakhon Pathom Rajabhat University to make use of the leftover leaves from the mulberry juice production process to develop into mulberry leaf tea, which can be marketed as an OTOP product. The value-added project includes the following steps:

- Provide knowledge and consulting services to assist in product development, production processes, marketing, distribution, and after-sales services.
- 150 students (primary grade 4 to secondary grade 3) established a club to manage the activities, and divided their roles and responsibilities clearly, so they can learn about the principles of doing business, from the calculation of cost and profit to managing the club’s funds, as well as adding value to the product by using the identity of the province as a hallmark of the product design.

# Partnership School Project

ThaiBev has joined the Ministry of Education to launch the Partnership School Project. This is the first time that the private sector, civil society, and other groups have had the opportunity to co-manage schools and develop courses tailored to the needs of local communities, while keeping a close eye on rapidly changing world contexts and dynamics. The project receives support and resources from sponsors. Together, they help schools develop curriculum and activities, manage human resources, and set guidelines to measure success. The project’s goal is to equip students with the skills for a successful life and career, and to be good citizens. In the first year of this project, ThaiBev sponsored 19 schools and helped more than 10,000 students. Various activities were organized to promote initiatives for local communities, including:

- **"Big Cleaning Day" at Ko Kha Kindergarten School, Lampang Province**: The activity was led by Mr. Kajorn Bhirakit, with over 70 employees from Thai Beverage Logistics Co., Ltd., the Lampang Provincial Administration Organization, Lampang’s Office of Non-Formal and Informal Education, and Ko Kha Kindergarten teachers, students, and parents, to maintain a clean and safe school environment.

- **"Big Cleaning Day" at Tha Chang Wittayakhan School, Surat Thani Province**: The activity was led by Ms. Orapan Yuvanavon and Mr. Chanawat Narwehg, who, along with employees from several ThaiBev groups, cleaned and upgraded the hygiene of the school’s drinking water pumping room. In addition, the Nathchai factory brought a tractor to help prepare land for a palm oil plantation project. Participants helped paint the school building and classroom walls, and cleaned out the gutters around the school.

- **HRH Princess Srinagarindra Demonstration School, Chiang Mai**: Led by Mr. Prapach Sabhavasu, sent its teachers for training at the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Centre in Chiang Mai Province. For this training program, a ThaiBev team helped offer training in male hairstyling, cooking, and art.

Currently, mulberry leaf tea products are available at the school’s welfare shop and community stores. The products are packaged in boxes and a set of souvenir boxes with pictures of the province’s landmarks. They also feature varied aromas. The project has become a prototype activity that pushes students to apply their knowledge so they can progress from OTOP Junior to Young OTOP, and in the future become entrepreneurs who are able to take care of both themselves and their families.

- Practice leadership skills and present them during the practice of business.

# Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project

This project recognizes the sacrifices made by teachers working in remote areas. Teachers from three agencies—the Office of Non-Formal and Informal Education, the Border Police Headquarters, and the Office of the Basic Education Commission—are selected to be honored with the Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teacher Prize. 

So far, 87 teachers have been given this prestigious honor during a ten-year period. ThaiBev has sponsored the Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teacher Prize for the past six years with 1 million baht per year. The prizes are divided into two categories: the first is for new recipients, in the amount of 900,000 baht; and the second category is for teachers who have been recognized with the award in the past. The second award is in the amount of 100,000 baht for the continued implementation of the Quality of Life and Environment Project.

The Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project has initiated various activities to promote and help create self-sustaining incomes for remote communities. Activities include the Vegetable Growing Table Project as a Source of Sufficient Economic Knowledge to the Community, and the Ban Nam Puk Sufficiency Economy Learning Centre as a source of knowledge. These projects have helped the communities to learn about the sufficiency economy, created jobs in the community, have their own funds for self-reliance, and developed additional skills in agriculture, livestock and fishery management, and forest conservation, to restore traditional local knowledge.

# Extra Courses for Careers with ThaiBev

ThaiBev organizes various courses to meet the needs of remote communities that are interested and well-suited for this project, which creates sustainable new ways for villagers to earn a living. It helps create a foundation for sustainability and reduces learning disparities. This project includes courses on hairstyling, sewing, cooking and baking, motorcycle maintenance, and recycling goods for use in household agriculture.

The Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teacher Prize is an award given to teachers who make sacrifices to perform their duties in remote and risky areas for a long time. These teachers have done good deeds for the school and students. Their aims are to help the students grow up to be good people with knowledge and morals. The teachers also are central to community development. If I had not worked with this project, I would not believe that in our country there are teachers who are so patient and so determined. Some teachers have had malaria more than 10 times a year. We have continued to give annual awards to every teacher who has received this award in the past, to fund creative projects that they wanted to develop, or to further build other projects that they have been doing but lacked the resources for, such as the Sufficiency Economy Learning Unit for Student Lunch Program, the Integrated Agriculture Project, and the Egg-laying Chicken Project, among others.

## Singha Saetueng

ThaiBev’s project to provide education for career enhancement is divided into three main categories:

1. **Organic Farming**: The school teaches students and also encourages villagers to farm organically without using chemicals. The produce can be sold back to the school as a community enterprise. The students who engage in organic farming can earn income during their time in school. In addition, organic farming improves their health by reducing exposure to chemicals.

2. **Hairstyling**: The children can turn this skill into a career which can generate extra income and funding for their higher education. There is one student who is a boxer and lives in Muangthong Boxing Camp; he served as the boxing camp’s barber as well. He once cut the hair of a world champion boxer.

3. **Cooking**: The students who participated in the program are able to prepare various types of food, such as stewed pork leg with rice, and chicken with rice. These are considered specialty dishes. When we have school visitors the children will cook these dishes for them. I think that the children who joined the program can definitely use these cooking skills for their future career.


# C asean

C asean, under the management of CAC Co., Ltd., is a social enterprise that functions as a center for networking and enhancing the potential of ASEAN countries with a focus on arts, culture, and business. The main target group is young people, an important resource for the future of the region.

Following the principle of sustainable development, C asean has organized a variety of activities, including training, seminars, conferences, and television shows, as well as the establishment of the C asean Consonant ASEAN Traditional Ensemble. It is hoped that the next generation will gain the knowledge, skills, and ideas that can foster a sustainable society that is connected in every dimension. This includes technology, arts, and culture. In 2018, C asean conducted the following activities:

- **C asean Sustainable Development Forum**  
  C asean, in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Program and the Business Development Institute for Society Foundation (FINSEDT), organized a Sustainable Development Forum and seminar this year in Bangkok. The event, “Transforming Asia Pacific: Innovative Solutions, Circular Economy and Low Carbon Lifestyles,” was held September 17–19 at C asean Centre. The purpose of the event was to emphasize the concept of sustainable business development by taking social and environmental impacts into account, both at the ASEAN and global level, according to the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy conceived and promoted by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The event aimed to prepare and encourage the private sector to conduct business with integrity and discretion, and take into account social and environmental impacts. The concept of a low-carbon-consumption lifestyle was at the core of the event, in order to mitigate climate change and build a foundation for sustainable development in ASEAN and at the global level.

- **Win-Win WAR Thailand project**  
  C asean launched the Win-Win WAR project to identify members of the new generation who are committed to create the business of their dreams, as well as sustainably support the environment and society. Through a competition, participants present their business plans by acting out a real situation in a reality show-type format, without any written script. This project provides a platform for aspiring business professionals to present ideas about their business, product, or service that meets the criteria of “Sustainable Business Development”.


# EISA: Educational Instituted Support Activities and Establishment of Simulated Business in Universities Project

ThaiBev has established Educational Instituted Support Activities (EISA) to promote sport activities at the university level and to support classroom courses so that students have real work experience to prepare themselves for life after graduation. In 2017–2018, the project set up a "Mini Mart" convenience store as "Trial company or Dummy Business" for students to practice working in a simulated business. The EISA project invited expert speakers in various fields from ThaiBev Group and the TCC Group to educate students so they can apply the knowledge gained from the simulated business experience. The simulated business project is a part of a course offered by the faculties of business administration at various universities that have participated in the project. 

In the past year, five stores have been opened: RBS Mart at Rangsit University, SWU Mart at Srinakharinwirot University Ongkharak Campus, RMUTR Mart at Rajamangala University of Technology Rattanakosin Salaya Campus, Smart Market at Silpakorn University Phetchaburi Campus, and KKW Mart at Rajamangala University of Technology Rattanakosin Wang Klai Kangwon Campus. Each of these stores will serve as an experimental learning resource for business administration students. Throughout the year, 400 students will practice working at these stores (five stores, 40 students per store each semester, two semesters per year).

The EISA project supports sports activities at universities for the youth to have a career path and brighter future. Apart from sports, we see opportunities to expand cooperation through other educational activities. We started to expand the program through four main areas: Sports, Sales, Brand Recognition (to be Top of Mind), and Pracharath Activities. In this program, everyone must share their knowledge and experience by creating a simulated business at the university. ThaiBev supports the businesses with expertise in store design, account management, stock management, and public relations. However, the students will have to manage the business by themselves. This will help them learn through the practice of actual work, rather than only theoretical knowledge in the classroom.

**Chanudom Kittisaret**

It’s a different experience from the classroom. We learn to solve many problems and do many things that we do not usually get to do in the classroom. We learn through practice and apply problem-solving methods learned from the training provided by ThaiBev in real situations. We learn to observe the consumers to see what they want or what they want more of, and we adjust to meet their needs. That is what we need to do to have satisfied customers.

In 2020, EISA projects aim to expand its network of simulated business stores throughout various universities in Bangkok and the vicinity, as well as at universities in major provinces across the country. In addition to increasing the number of stores, the project also plans to become more efficient by promoting current shops to run on their own sustainably, for example, the CU Waste Zero project of Chulalongkorn University and the TU-Smart University project of Thammasat University. These projects can become a resource for learning and provide experiences for future generations of students.

## Creating the New Generation of Social Entrepreneurs project (Beta Young Entrepreneur)

is a project based on the collaboration of three organizations: the Thai Chamber of Commerce, the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, and the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation. Together these organizations are training a new generation of university students to be entrepreneurs, with a special focus on releasing their potential and promoting strong virtues, ethics and social responsibility when doing business. The main activities are divided into two areas:

- **Business Activities**: The students will intern at Thai Beverage Public Company Limited or associated companies (Freshmen). They will learn about and experience a real business environment through the building of a 20,000 baht start-up business (Sophomore), simulated business (Junior) and field visits to companies in the ThaiBev group.

- **Social Activities**: These activities help instill morals, ethics, and social responsibility through activities provided by ThaiBev such as "ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold", The Water Festival and the River Festival.

The program has produced four new generations of entrepreneurs, covering 134 students overall. The graduates from this project have chosen to work in different careers; some have run their own businesses; others have continued their family businesses or worked in offices; while others have continued their studies.

Among the students who have graduated from the program and carried on in business, many started their own businesses, including a cat hotel, a bag business, concert event organizing and other event organizing companies. Some continued in their family business, such as a coffee shop, a gas station, a pig farm, a wholesale toy shop, and a children’s clothing store. Some continued their work that began with their 20,000 baht start up business, such as an accessories shop, online clothing shop, and a bottle garden.

ThaiBev believes that it will be able to continuously create a new generation of good and capable entrepreneurs.

I am glad and proud that everyone has gained knowledge and experience. What is very important is that we must try and learn to do what we believe is also useful to ourselves. With the knowledge we have gained from this project, from the university’s curriculum, from the teachers who have taught and given us guidance, what important is that we have real experience for ourselves. We aim to create and develop students to be strong, committed, confident and step up to be the next generation of entrepreneurs to create a quality society for our country.

When we work with others, we will sometimes run into conflict. If I had not done the simulated business or other activities with my classmates while in the university, I would not be able to solve problems when I am working. For example, when I have a conflict with someone, I learned how to handle it, and how to help myself to be able to work better. All of this experience I gained from the business simulation program.

Joining a UTCC Beta Dummy Business is a big plus that can definitely provide you useful to experience to apply to your business. At that time, it was the beginning of the dummy business, we faced many problems and had to solve them all. Some problems we were able to solve, others we could not. Finally, when we had to manage our own business, we felt like we had faced those problems before. So, it helped set quite a stable foundation for our own business. We got to learn about all these systems, stocking, accounting, and store management, marketing, organizing various promotions, and customer service. We integrated these experiences we got from the dummy business into our own business.

The skills I learned from the start-up business were related to sales and marketing. With the 20,000 baht provided by the foundation, I was able to sell products and meet customers on my own. This experience helped improve my marketing skills, which I might not have gained experience in otherwise.

**Professor Emeritus Thirachai Chantharotsiri**  
M.D., Director of Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital

I would like to thank Thai Beverage Public Company Limited for recognizing the importance of creating social benefit through the continuous promotion of public health and the wellbeing of members of society. In ensuring the health and wellbeing of the people, the company has provided support for and also established many useful public health projects through the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation, such as the Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital founded on the great auspicious occasion of His Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s Diamond Jubilee in 2006. In remembrance of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s graciousness to the people of Thailand, Khun Charoen, Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi and the Sirivadhanabhakdi family established “Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital,” the first kidney hospital in Thailand. Furthermore, Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn is the chairperson of the Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital foundation. It aims for the hospital to become the leading specialized hospital in Asia, providing comprehensive care for patients with renal disease. In addition to the establishment of this hospital, ThaiBev continues to support other important public health initiatives on behalf of the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation by Khun Charoen and Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi.


# Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital

The hospital has been operating since September 2012, providing a total of 279,135 outpatient services and 151,302 rounds of dialysis to patients. The hospital is expanding its dialysis services through the addition of 16 hemodialysis machines. The number of patients undergoing vascular surgery was 1,493. There were 826 cases of kidney and urinary tract and prostate surgeries, and 7 renal transplant surgeries successfully completed. The hospital has also educated people about kidney disease and self-care every three months, for a total of 16 times, reaching over 4,000 participants.

In addition, a kidney disease prevention project has been undertaken in a community in Kamphaeng Phet Province, and a research project provides patients with kidney problems with knowledge about the disease so that they can better live with the condition and improve their quality of life. A collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health provides care and kidney disease prevention in communities and in various hospitals under the Ministry of Public Health nationwide.

# "Chang Clinical Medicine" Project

This mobile clinic is in Khlong Khlung District, Kamphaeng Phet Province. It was founded to provide free treatment to community members in Kamphaeng Phet Province and in neighboring areas. It provides access to treatment and care by effective caregivers. The project follows the determination of Khun Charoen and Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi, President and Vice Chairman of Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, who said since its founding that “Thai people can share with each other.”

In addition to medical assistance in the community around the factory, the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation and ThaiBev also have ongoing projects, such as the annual health check-up program for students and teachers of Wat Homkret School. Another project is the “Prostheses for the Handicapped and Health Examination for the Elderly” that has provided 60 prostheses to disabled persons and 100 health checkups to the elderly. It has also provided hearing aids, eyeglasses, and wood crutches for elderly people free of charge.


### Other Public Health Projects:

- Established the Sirivadhanabhakdi Building 1-2 at Wat Yan Sangwararam Hospital, Chonburi Province.

- Provided medical equipment to the Ministry of Public Health in order to support various projects. ThaiBev has also sponsored the Annual Non-Communicable Disease Conference (NCD Forum) in 2016 and 2017, allocating one million baht per year. In addition, it donated medical equipment to hospitals under the Ministry of Public Health, including Chao Praya Aphai Phubet Hospital, Pattani Hospital, Phra Buddhachinaraj Hospital, Sampran Hospital in Nakhon Pathom Province, Maharaj Hospital in Nakhon Sri Thammarat Province, and Cha Uat Hospital in Nakhon Sri Thammarat Province.

Society should be dedicated to disseminating the Thai identity in ASEAN and the wider world.

- In the art and culture sphere, ThaiBev’s commitment is defined by three strategies: conservation, cooperation and creation.

- ThaiBev supports the new generation to learn and train in the various branches of art and culture beyond their regular learning through the textbook and classroom.

Director of Art and Culture Program

As ThaiBev is one of the biggest companies in Thailand, we believe that it is our duty to give back to society, over and above our normal business operations. ThaiBev is involved in a number of special programs promoting art and culture widely in Thai society. To help inspire art and culture over the last 15 years, we have established activities which are special in many aspects.

We can see that art and culture are important and are part of the nation’s roots. As a representation of nationhood, they show that Thailand is an old country with a long history. Thailand has many fine arts, culture and customs, which not all countries can boast. Therefore, we should conserve the good things that we have, whether through the efforts of young or old people. This is a commitment and obligation we consistently consider.

## Dusadee Banomyong

Director of SuanPlu Chorus

In the recent past, ThaiBev’s role in promoting art and culture has reflected its vision of supporting the development of Thai society in all aspects, as the government sector has not been able to distribute its budgets evenly, particularly covering art and culture, which is no less important than sports or other pursuits. Through fine arts and culture, which should be conserved and handed down to younger generations, Thailand can be made more secure and equal to other countries. From the perspective of the SuanPlu Chorus, this support is a strong point of ThaiBev. Besides manufacturing consumer goods, the company is regarded by the public for promoting community products, demonstrating that the company has taken part in developing the country.

Luang Pradit Phairoh (Sorn Silapanablenj) Foundation

The Luang Pradit Phairoh (Sorn Silapanablenj) Foundation has received continuous support from ThaiBev for the annual Sorn Daeng [Golden Arrow] Thai music competition for the Trophy of His Late Majesty King Rama IX. It has also received support for other projects such as the Thai Music Youth Camp, Friends of Music project and the establishment of the ASEAN Thai Youth Orchestra. ThaiBev has given the Foundation full freedom to organize activities with the joint goal of creating quality young people with rounded knowledge and abilities in art and culture, and also creating a support network for the future. For over five years the Foundation has received support for its musical activities; it has come to realize that ThaiBev is giving its support unconditionally and from the heart without any business conditions. The company has also suggested channels for further activities involving the cooperation of other agencies for even greater benefit.

ThaiBev is a management organization with heart, personality, variety, etiquette and vision. That affects the overall picture of the organization. Demonstrate public spirit, be willing to help others in project activities, support society, invite friends to work together: This is the foundation of a sustainable organization.

The Bangkok Art and Culture Centre (BACC) is an urban art gallery tasked with being an extracurricular source of knowledge about art and culture for children and young people, both in Bangkok and its environs. In the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre’s 10 years of operations, ThaiBev has clearly identified itself as a private sector company which sees the value and importance of maintaining and disseminating art and culture. It was the first sponsor of various contemporary art exhibitions at BACC and has maintained its sponsorship over many years. This reflects the strong point of ThaiBev, that its management see the value and importance of passing on the heritage of modern art and culture to the new generation. It is outstanding as a modern organization because it does not stay still; this is a highly important component of developing and creating value together for society on a sustainable basis.

## Ekachai Jearakul
**Winner of GFA Guitar Foundation of America International Concert Artist Competition 2014 and a young person in the ThaiBev ThaiTalent program**

ThaiBev sees the huge importance of making an effort to drive art and culture, especially music. I have had the opportunity to be sponsored by ThaiBev for a long time, including at international music competitions, which helps Thailand’s classical music scene to be better known internationally. There is also the project to record the musical compositions of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and sponsorship of many concerts. ThaiBev is an “opportunity giver”, because I have been able to grow and make a contribution from the opportunities given to me by ThaiBev.


# STORY

Promoting art and culture has been a key obligation of ThaiBev throughout its history. ThaiBev has joined various organizations with the goal of making both Thai and international art and culture to be esteemed, conserved, developed and supported with projects and activities to an international standard. This combines academic working methods to create value for society through development, learning and awareness. If society values its art and culture, this will foster patriotism and pride in cultural heritage. If these values are disseminated, this will create value for ThaiBev, as a company of good governance campaigning in these matters.

# Bangkok Art Biennale 2018

Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn officially opened Bangkok Art Biennale 2018 at BAB BOX Art Gallery on October 30, 2018.

## Insight

Bangkok Art Biennale 2018 was the first of its kind in Bangkok, and came about through substantial coordination between the state and the private sector. I must thank the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the Tourism Authority of Thailand, various foreign embassies in Thailand, and our network of partners who sponsored this world-class art event, which is to be held every two years.

For the Bangkok Art Biennale 2018, we were all committed to the same hope of making Bangkok a global center for modern art and to help stimulate the tourism industry, generating income for all, from the community of art lovers to the community economy in the areas that the Biennale was held. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports had set an income target from tourism in 2018 of 3 trillion baht. Throughout the four-month duration of the Bangkok Art Biennale, the event attracted tourists, art collectors, curators, artists and the rest of the art scene from all over the world in large numbers, representing massive economic value. We expect that the Bangkok Art Biennale will continue to be an important part of helping the tourism industry meet its revenue targets from quality tourism. It will also help to enhance the country's tourism image in every dimension, particularly by highlighting Thai art and culture to both Thai and foreign tourists, and by spreading Thainess around the world.

Besides support for tourism, there was an activity for art lovers in Thailand called "DEK BAB". This was an opportunity for volunteers such as students and members of the public to participate in the Bangkok Art Biennale, acting in the role of ambassadors, connecting the artists with their viewers, whether Thai or foreign, and putting the Biennale in the context of Bangkok. The "DEK BAB" made this Bangkok Art Biennale complete – there were over 700 volunteers. The DEK BAB themselves gained knowledge, experience and understanding of art, and shared it with others.

# Independent Assurance Statement

## LRQA Assurance Statement

Relating to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for the financial year 2018 (1 October 2017 – 30 September 2018)

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.

### Terms of Engagement

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev) to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report for the financial year 2018 ("the Report") against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s verification approach. LRQA’s verification approach is based on current best practice and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) - Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Reliability of performance data and processes defined in ISAE3000.

Our assurance engagement covered ThaiBev’s operations and activities in Thailand, including its subsidiary companies and specifically the following requirements:

- Looking at how ThaiBev has applied the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, 2016 to prepare this Report; especially whether they have followed the Universal standard for:
  - Stakeholder Inclusiveness and Materiality reporting principles
  - GRI 102-18 Governance Structure.

- Evaluating the reliability of data and information for the following topic specific standards:
  - **Economic:**
    - GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed
  - **Environmental:**
    - GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization
    - GRI 305-1 Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions
    - GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions
    - GRI 303-1 Total water withdrawal by source
    - GRI 303-3 Water recycled and reused
    - GRI 306-1 Water discharge by quality and destination
    - GRI 306-2 Waste by type and disposal method
  - **Social:**
    - GRI 403-2 Types of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, absenteeism and number of work-related fatalities
    - GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee*
    - GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews*
    - GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs.
      - Note: GRI 403-2, 404-1,3, cover 69 subsidiaries company

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s operations and activities outside of Thailand.

LRQA’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

### LRQA’s Opinion

Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information for the selected topic specific standards
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier.

*Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.*

### LRQA’s Approach

LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with LRQA’s Report Verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Reviewing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement and determining material issues to confirm that this information had been used to prepare their Report. We did this by comparing reports written by ThaiBev’s peers to establish whether the majority of sector issues were included in this Report.

# Lloyd's Register LRQA

- **Checking** whether ThaiBev had followed GRI’s Universal Standard for disclosing their Governance Structure. This was confirmed by ensuring that the duty for sustainable development was part of ThaiBev’s senior management’s responsibility.
- **Auditing** ThaiBev’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions, or misstatements in the Report. This involved reviewing the effectiveness of data handling processes and systems, and speaking with key personnel responsible for compiling the data and information.
- **Undertaking site visits** to understand the data management systems, as well as sampling the data to confirm the reliability of the topic-specific standards. Sites visited were:
  - Non-alcoholic beverage plant (Sermsuk, Pathum Thani)
  - Spirits plant (Sangsom Co., Ltd., Nakornpathom)
  - Beer plant (Beer Thai (1991) Public Company Limited, Kamphangphet)

Note: LRQA did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations.

## Observations

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:

- **Inclusivity**:
  - No key stakeholder groups have been excluded from ThaiBev’s stakeholder engagement process. Future engagements should include other stakeholders affected by ThaiBev’s operations, e.g., temporary workers.

- **Materiality**:
  - ThaiBev has validated its material issues using its existing materiality assessment process. These issues are part of Management’s sustainability strategy and vision 2020.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - ThaiBev has policies to address stakeholders’ concerns. To achieve sustainability performance, both group and site levels should further advance their policies and strategies.

- **Reliability**:
  - ThaiBev’s data management system remains unchanged. It is recommended that ThaiBev adopt a QA/QC system to internally verify its data management systems, improving data reliability and ensuring consistent reporting methodologies.

## LRQA’s Competence and Independence

LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training, and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is reviewed by senior management to ensure a rigorous and transparent approach.

This verification is the only work undertaken by LRQA for ThaiBev and does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
