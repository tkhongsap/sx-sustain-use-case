# Message from the CEO

Dear Stakeholders,

Even as the world celebrates the gradual return to normalcy after the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued impact of climate change has drawn increasing global focus on sustainable development. As a beverage and food leader in the ASEAN region, all of us at ThaiBev are conscious that industry leadership is not only about ensuring our Group’s business resilience and operational excellence, but also about protecting the environment, supporting local communities, and enhancing governance.

ThaiBev honors the royal command of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua to continue, maintain and extend for the benefit and happiness of the people and the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy according to the initiative of His Late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great as a guideline for sustainable development. In 2022, we have formulated a sustainability strategy based on the concept “Enabling Sustainable Growth” through three pillars: environment, society, and good governance, with clearly measurable goals in each area to cover all dimensions of sustainable development.

Under the Environmental pillar, we have pledged to achieve Net-Zero emissions from our operations (Scope 1) and purchased energy use (Scope 2) by 2040, as well as 100% water replenishment by the same year. We are currently participating in CDP Climate disclosure for the first time. This additional disclosure will shed more light for our stakeholders on ThaiBev’s greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and how we manage risks from climate change.

Under the Social pillar, we set out to improve employee engagement across the Group, and to provide our employees with more opportunities to upskill and reskill. We also aim to derive 80% of our non-alcoholic beverage sales from healthy beverages by 2030, while uplifting communities through five types of programs: education, public health, sports, arts and culture, and community development.

Under the Governance pillar, we are implementing effective work standards across all ThaiBev Group entities, while working closely with our suppliers and business partners to enable responsible sourcing and sustainable supply chain operations.

In addition to embedding ESG into our business operations, we have leveraged our leadership position in the industry to organize various sustainability-related initiatives. In 2022, ThaiBev co-hosted the largest sustainability expo in ASEAN: Sustainability Expo 2022 (SX2022) at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center on September 26–October 2, 2022. The Sustainability Expo aims to encourage organizations from all sectors to collaborate with the public to work towards a sustainable society and reduce long-term environmental impacts. It provides a neutral platform to support global efforts to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. More than 100 international and Thai organizations and 400 practitioners from around the world shared their sustainable development experience and perspectives.

Fully recognizing that ThaiBev’s ability to achieve our PASSION 2025 goals is closely intertwined with healthy natural environment and inclusive communities, I would like to thank our employees, suppliers and customers, business partners, investors and all stakeholders for their support and trust in ThaiBev, as well as for their contribution to our sustainability journey. We are committed to working with you towards a clean environment and sustainable future, as stated in our mission of “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth”.

Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi  
President and CEO



# Board Statement

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) reaffirms its belief that the business strategy of Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (“ThaiBev”) must focus on sustainable development to ensure the Group’s long-term resilience and safeguard the interests of all its stakeholders. ThaiBev and the Board are inspired by the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy of our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, and further guided by His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua’s first royal command, “to continue, sustain, and develop this legacy for the benefit and happiness of the people.” The Board believes that these principles will guide ThaiBev’s mission in “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth” with all stakeholders.

The Board thus oversees ThaiBev’s sustainability efforts and makes sure that sustainability goals and targets relating to environmental, social and governance issues are integrated into ThaiBev’s business and value creation initiatives. Under the Board’s oversight, ThaiBev’s Sustainability and Risk Management Committee has approved the Group’s sustainability strategy of “Enabling Sustainable Growth.” The sustainability strategy will enable ThaiBev to be resilient across its businesses, while protecting the environment, supporting local communities, and practicing good corporate governance. Clear ESG targets and initiatives have been set, including a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 2040. The Board fully endorses this sustainability strategy and targets.

ThaiBev has also adopted the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and published its inaugural TCFD report in 2021. In addition, it is participating in the annual CDP for the first time - the ensuing report will enable stakeholders to better understand ThaiBev’s exposure to climate-related risks and how we manage such risks.

ThaiBev’s sustainability performance has consistently been recognized by global indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), the DJSI World Index and the DJSI Emerging Markets Index. The Board believes that, through a concerted effort by everyone within the organization, ThaiBev will continue to perform well in all ESG dimensions. The Board is also committed to ensuring that ThaiBev continues to adopt meaningful ESG practices and take the lead in enhancing sustainable development in the beverage and food industry.

We look forward to sharing our progress with you.

Board of Directors  
Thai Beverage Public Company Limited



# Stable & Sustainable ASEAN Leader

**ThaiBev**

ThaiBev is inspired by the first royal proclamation of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua (Rama X) “to continue, sustain and develop, and rule the land with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the people forever,” by adopting the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great (Rama IX). ThaiBev has integrated SEP principles and values into its own sustainable development approach under the concept of “Enabling Sustainable Growth,” and is dedicated to operating its businesses in accordance with ESG principles, carefully preserving the environment and society and faithfully practicing good governance, with a focus on sustainable development in all dimensions. This approach is pursued with a network of partners in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the organization's long-standing mission of “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth” to benefit the wellbeing of all societies in which we operate.

Headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand, ThaiBev features four main business groups: spirits, beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and food. ThaiBev was listed on the Singapore Exchange Mainboard in 2006 and is currently one of the Exchange’s top 10 companies by market capitalization.

In 2012, ThaiBev expanded beyond Thailand through the acquisition of Fraser and Neave Limited, a well-established conglomerate with a portfolio of highly recognized beverage brands. In 2017, we further strengthened our regional presence by acquiring stakes in Grand Royal Group (“GRG”), the largest whisky player in Myanmar, and in Saigon Beer-Alcohol-Beverage Corporation (“SABECO”), a leading beer producer in Vietnam.

## Overview

Our sustainability and ESG approach is inspired by the determination of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua to continue, sustain, and develop the legacy of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great. SEP is a principles-based framework that promotes balanced development with respect to the environment, economy, community, and local culture. By applying the wisdom of SEP, ThaiBev believes we can attain a world-class standard of ESG and effectively engage local stakeholders, while also addressing global issues and contributing to international agendas such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ThaiBev is also a staunch advocate of the Thai government’s Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) national development strategy, which seeks new ways to unlock growth, while protecting the environmental, economic, social, and cultural well-being of the country.

We create accountability and transparency through our participation and disclosures in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and CDP. We then set clear goals and action plans to improve our performance in all areas, especially in those that represent key materials issues related to our operations or impacting society at large. For example, in October 2022, ThaiBev announced new commitments focusing on a broad range of key material issues that involve the company and its stakeholders. These pledges include Net Zero targets in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2040, as well as targets for water replenishment and biodiversity.

We are enacting policies and plans that focus on creating collaboration for actions on ESG across our existing ecosystems. These plans include public platforms, collaborations with partners, and continuous assessment and improvement of our own operations. In this way, ThaiBev can grow new business opportunities, strengthen its competitive advantages, unlock the full value of potential opportunities, and continue to pursue meaningful sustainability initiatives under its mission of “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth” with stakeholders, while also positively impacting the well-being of society, the environment, and the world.

# Governance Structure

Only through strong governance can our sustainability mission and goals be achieved. We recently revised our sustainability governance structure to ensure that our sustainability strategy will be fully integrated with our business transformation. This structure requires strong commitment and substantial engagement across our many business units in multiple countries and recognizes the interlinkage between sustainability, business strategy and risk management.

Engagement and leadership begins with our Board of Directors, which is responsible for overseeing and determining the company's overall ESG, business and risk strategies, and guiding the organization toward stable and sustainable growth for the benefit of all stakeholders. Under the 2022 ESG strategy "Enabling Sustainable Growth," the Board believes we can grow our business and reduce risk, while creating numerous opportunities for our stakeholders and ultimately share these benefits with society as a whole.

The Board-appointed Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC) further helps formulate the company's ESG strategy and risk management policies, and oversees ESG and risk management activities in accordance with the policies and strategies set by the Board.

For the first time, in 2022 the President and CEO appointed an Executive Vice President, to act as Chief of Sustainability and Strategy, to ensure the company's group strategy and business transformation is integrated with its sustainability plans. Chief of Sustainability and Strategy also serves as secretary of the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC), which is supported by the Sustainability Development Working Team (SDWT). SDWT, comprised of representatives from different business units, develops plans and ESG projects and participates in corporate sustainability assessments that verify the comprehensiveness of material sustainability topics. The SDWT also monitors and reports the progress of ESG programs to the SRMC.

ThaiBev also links ESG targets to annual variable performance-related compensation (such as bonuses), so that achieving ESG is part of the mission of all employees. Similarly, ThaiBev's ESG mission is spread to suppliers who complete assessments of their own sustainability performance and risks, implement codes of conduct, and are encouraged to be responsible by constantly monitoring and assessing their operations for risk and areas of improvement. Best performers are recognized through an annual supplier awards program.

# Insights

## M.L. Dispanadda Diskul
**CEO of Mae Fah Luang Foundation under Royal Patronage (MFLF)**

Climate change is at the forefront of global conversation, with its ramifications now widely felt across borders. Unfortunately, Thailand’s climate mitigation and adaptation efforts have not met expectations on swift implementation. This may be due to the lack of regulation control or practical action supported by scientific evidence. While fortunate that Thailand has yet to feel any direct impact from several typhoons, the country is still widely affected by droughts and flooding.

Flooding especially, is likely to be a continuous occurrence, particularly in the central region where water runs from the north and is unable to flow back into the sea due to high tide. Such conditions exacerbate losses in agricultural production and disrupt the supply chain in the food and beverage industry. Without innovative policies and action plans to safeguard its production from floods, Thailand’s competitiveness in the F&B industry will likely fall within the circle of neighbouring countries. In terms of climate change impacts to the organization, supply chain management is more likely a concern due to agricultural damage caused by flooding. Therefore, ThaiBev should consider on how to secure these raw materials and prevent any disruption in its production process.

ThaiBev has potential to enhance its position as global companies if they can clearly portrait progress of implementing set sustainability targets. Such implementation, including the creation of an inclusive economy or supply chain management, will not only benefit the organisation, but also other stakeholders - particularly local communities. Consequently, ThaiBev should present itself as a spokesperson to connect people, private companies, and the government to collaborate in accelerating sustainable policies.

With regards to social contribution, ThaiBev has been working with Mae Fah Luang Foundation on community forest rehabilitation projects for many years, a practice of replanting new trees and preserving existing forests for conservation. While tree planting produces carbon credit returns, sole focus on this may increase the likelihood of demolishing existing forests for replanting purposes, leading to biodiversity loss. Therefore, the work on preserving the existing forest area is also an important task which ThaiBev understands this very well.

To progress towards sustainable development and address climate change, comprehensive planning in collaboration with the other stakeholders is necessary. ThaiBev needs to be an inspiration that can support and generate the highest form of benefit for all parties.

Climate-related impact is undoubtedly real, affecting the global community and its economy. The negative effects climate change has brought to the environment have deranged social mitigation efforts, such as curbing poverty and reducing social inequity. With increasing awareness of such global impact, organisations and businesses should address these concerns and avoid facing regulation and reputation risks.

Aligned with the Paris agreement, organisations are expected to contribute to national and global climate targets by implementing climate mitigation and emission-reduction actions through technology/innovation, financial investments, and education for stakeholders and the wider community. Private sector players with high climate capacity should also support communities/small business to increase their own climate adaptation capacity. For example, initiatives to protect green areas and forests are not only acts of climate mitigation, but also supports livelihood and preserves biodiversity. It is admirable that ThaiBev has been consistent in its position and approach to climate action throughout the years. In addition to ThaiBev’s current efforts, it would be beneficial to see ThaiBev enhance stakeholder communication to create mutual understanding and awareness to expand partnership and cooperation in climate action.

Lastly, ThaiBev can also play a significant role in advocating shared responsibility for climate change, including the need for immediate and collective mitigation action. With efforts in educating and preparing stakeholders for climate change, climate resilience can thus be achieved.

**Herry Cho**  
Head of Sustainability and Sustainable Finance, SGX, Singapore

Since sustainability reporting requirements were introduced for SGX listed companies in 2016, there has been significant development in sustainability trends and expectations. Topics that have made their way into discussions among investors and companies are supply chain resilience and climate change, which are of serious considerations among companies in the food and beverage industry, due to its consumer-focused nature.

As climate change is a rising global concern, SGX has made climate-related financial disclosures aligned with the TCFD requirements mandatory for companies from five sectors, as part of companies’ sustainability disclosure journey. Managing climate change topics is not just about climate mitigation actions; it requires a holistic approach that covers social and environmental aspects to embed the topic into companies’ materiality process, governance, strategy, risk management, metrics, and targets.

From investors’ perspective, a key component that is being focused on with regards to how companies manage their climate change topics is their approach to science-based targets and Scope 3 emissions calculation and management, i.e., policies and reducing emission footprint. Another topic that has been mentioned regularly by investors is diversity, such as the consideration of gender and ethnic ratios at board level. The topic of biodiversity will also potentially rise in importance in relation to impacts from business operations. In addition, investors are now looking for a more holistic approach to data collection of companies. SGX has observed a rise in the use of AI-based solutions for data collection and analysis. Therefore, it is important for companies to keep close observation of where their data is disclosed, ensuring its accuracy and completeness.

ThaiBev has done well in aligning with various frameworks and covering broader topics that range from social to environmental aspects. To date, ThaiBev has substantially covered the key components of sustainability and forward trends. Specifically on climate change, ThaiBev has already completed the measurement of their Scope 3 emissions along with third-party verification, and aligned their climate disclosure with TCFD. It will be ideal practice for ThaiBev to reach out to external stakeholders for their materiality exercise and engagement. With various frameworks/standards to align to, what ThaiBev can further develop on would be to ensure that stakeholders can easily approach and navigate ThaiBev’s information, such as specific framework content indexes and providing clear links to data sources.

# Stakeholder Engagement

ThaiBev has created guidelines for appropriate stakeholder engagement, emphasizing the promotion of creative engagement through various activities and communication channels. Requests, opinions, concerns, and suggestions may be voiced through these channels. For each stakeholder group, the frequency of communication varies by operation. The feedback is useful in determining the strategy, direction, plans, and guidelines for future business sustainability development and for the prevention of risks or impacts from business operations.

# Assessment of Key Sustainability Issues

ThaiBev continuously reviews its key sustainability issues through stakeholder engagement and by considering global trends, standards, changes, and impacts with regards to sustainability in the food and beverage industry. We perform a new materiality assessment every three years and review the assessment annually through the following processes:

## 1. Identification of Issues

We organize workshops for executives and experts from various business units to examine and determine which sustainability issues are most relevant to business operations. This involves analyzing global trends and changes in sustainability issues, and identifying stakeholder groups and corporate sustainability issues.

## 2. Issue Prioritization

We prioritize sustainability issues through two primary activities:

1. Workshops for senior ThaiBev executives to consider and assess the impacts of sustainability issues on the organization by considering them across three aspects: finance, operations, and reputation.
2. In-depth interviews with domestic and international representatives from eight stakeholder groups to understand their significance and potential impacts.

These two activities are applied to better understand sustainability issues facing the organization. Issues ranked as very important by ThaiBev and its stakeholders are considered material sustainability issues.

## 3. Validation

The Sustainability Development Working Team (SDWT) reviews and presents material sustainability issues to the Executive Committee for approval.

## 4. Reporting Boundary

To effectively address material sustainability issues, ThaiBev determines the reporting boundary of all 17 material sustainability issues based on information collected from various agencies and relevant stakeholder groups.

## 5. Continuous Development

ThaiBev operates under a sustainable development framework through an annual review of sustainability issues, taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives, and also through in-depth interviews. Material sustainability issues help to guide the company’s business operations.

# ThaiBev Material Sustainability Issues

ThaiBev continues to review 17 material sustainability issues facing the organization in response to global trends, impact to business and stakeholder concerns.

An assessment of material sustainability issues determined that stakeholders are concerned about the safety of both products and services, as well as employees’ safety in the workplace. Supply chain disruptions have further impacted key sustainability issues with important implications. Major issues include:

# Managing Environmental Impacts

ThaiBev’s policies and practices throughout the company’s value chain aim to minimize environmental impacts for the benefit of current and future generations. These policies apply to all employees, and fall under national and international laws, regulations, and standards, including ISO 14001 and ISO 50001.

Moreover, ThaiBev fully supports the Thai government’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, and the company strives to be Thailand’s industry leader in reducing GHG emissions to support the global fight against climate change.

# Climate Change

Climate change imposes multi-dimensional impacts not only on environmental conditions but also on economic and community well-being. ThaiBev recognizes the need to accelerate its actions to address the climate crisis, while contributing to global efforts to limit the global temperature increase to below 1.5°C as part of its contribution to the Paris Agreement, and improving the company’s resilience to potential climate impacts. The company acknowledges the importance of managing climate-related risks, as well as maximizing the opportunities from climate change, to ensure a sustainable long-term future for its food and beverage operations. In doing so, ThaiBev engages with direct and indirect value-chain partners to help them align their activities with the Paris Agreement and international best practices.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev's sustainability strategy has well-defined environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives and goals, including a clear target to achieve Net-Zero carbon emissions by 2040.

The strategy will enable ThaiBev to drive sustainable development and resilience across its business, protect the environment, support local communities and enhance governance. The company's commitment to "Enabling Sustainable Growth" strategy sets out quantifiable targets to help it achieve sustainability and Net-Zero emissions.

ThaiBev has integrated climate-change risks and opportunities into its strategy and operations to drive continued improvement and to enhance its resilience to climate change, while also enhancing value creation for the business and connected communities. The company uses this strategy to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations.

To ensure accountability for sustainability and climate-related actions, ThaiBev has integrated ESG and climate change-related key performance indicators (KPIs) and monetary incentives as part of employees' targets, for example:

- **Company targets of**
  - 50% reduction of GHG emissions in Scopes 1 and 2 combined by 2030 (compared to base year 2019)
  - 50% renewable energy use by 2030

- **Business unit managers' target of more than 5% reduction in water intensity by 2025 (compared to base year 2019)**

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

- **50% renewable energy used by 2030**
- **Net-zero GHG emissions for Scope 1 & 2 by 2040**

## 2022 Highlight

With its ambition to achieve Net Zero by 2040 for Scopes 1 and 2, ThaiBev is one step closer to becoming a low-carbon business on its journey towards climate resilience. In 2022, the company has been able to enhance its climate transition and physical risk assessments as well as TCFD-aligned disclosures. ThaiBev is committed to continue its carbon-reduction initiatives and strategies.

### 1. Governance

ThaiBev has implemented climate-related scenario analysis, physical and transition risks, and opportunity analysis, and created awareness on TCFD reporting by hosting training sessions throughout the organization. To ensure accountability for sustainability and climate-related actions, ThaiBev has integrated ESG, climate change-related key performance indicators (KPIs) and monetary incentives into employees’ targets.

## 2. Strategy

ThaiBev has integrated climate-change risks and opportunities into its strategy and operations to drive continued improvement and to enhance its resilience to climate change, while also enhancing value creation for the business and connected communities.

![Three Pillars of ThaiBev’s Climate Strategy](#)

- **Pillar 1: Adaptation**
  - Improve ThaiBev resilience to physical climate risks
  - Resilience and adaptive capacity to climate hazard and natural disasters
  - Water efficiency and replenishment
  - Climate resilience of supply chains

- **Pillar 2: Transition Risks/GHG Mitigation**
  - Improve ThaiBev resilience to transition risks & GHG emissions
  - GHG Reduction Targets
  - Product Stewardship & Circular Economy
  - Low Carbon Solutions
  - Stakeholder Capability Building

- **Pillar 3: Communities**
  - Support climate action & livelihood development in communities connected to ThaiBev operations
  - GHG reduction of climate-related community projects
  - Improve community livelihoods and sustainability through climate projects

**Vision:**  
Improve ThaiBev’s climate resilience and support a low-carbon economy in line with the 1.5-2°C pathway.

**Ambition:**  
“To adapt to and mitigate climate change while enhancing value creation for ThaiBev’s business and connected communities”.

ThaiBev has developed a climate strategy that implements projects throughout its operations and value chain to mitigate potential risks and create opportunities from both physical and transition impacts. These projects include supplier engagement initiatives, development of low-carbon products, reforestation and mangrove rehabilitation, and organic farming initiatives. Similarly, ThaiBev uses this climate strategy to inform financial planning conversations and modeling.

### Scenario Analysis of Climate Risks and Opportunities

ThaiBev has conducted an in-depth scenario analysis for both physical risks and transition risks and opportunities. Physical risk assessment was conducted using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and considered the following natural hazards: riverine floods, storms, water stress, seawater intrusion, and increasing temperature. Transition risk assessment was conducted based on the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS).

# Climate Change

In addition, ThaiBev has conducted Water Sustainability Assessments (WSA) for its production plants, including both surface water and groundwater, for an in-depth assessment of any potential climate-related risks.

ThaiBev has identified timeframes for climate-related physical and transition risks in line with the timeframes used for business operations. These timeframes are as follows: short term (1-3 years), medium term (3-10 years), and long term (>10 years).

## Physical Risk Analysis

ThaiBev conducted desktop-based physical risk assessment of prominent natural hazards at 35 locations in Thailand and Myanmar, as shown below.

### ThaiBev Physical Risk Scenario Analysis (2020-2022)

| Purpose | To analyse whether physical related risks (both acute and chronic) have a significant impact on ThaiBev’s business in the future, and what mitigation measures/adaptation plans are required for significant risks. |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scenarios | - RCP 2.6 / SSP1-2.6 scenario: Low emissions. A pathway to limit warming to below 2°C. <br> - RCP 4.5 scenario: Intermediate emissions. A pathway that global temperature rises by 2.5 - 3°C. <br> - RCP 8.5 scenario: High emissions. A pathway that represents a baseline where no additional mitigation measures are implemented, assuming that temperature increase will be about 4.3 °C by 2100. |
| Scenario Time Horizons | - 2030 (near-term): covered "Short-term" and "Medium-term" timeframes <br> - 2050 and 2080 (long-term): covered "Long-term" timeframe - for RCP 2.6 scenario only <br> These scenario time horizons are aligned with ThaiBev’s timeframes for risk and opportunity identification. |
| Target area of analysis | Operations and supply chain |
| Scope of financial impact calculations | 35 locations in Thailand and Myanmar, accounting for 61% of the total number of factories. |

| Riverine floods <br> **Timeframe:** Medium term (3-10 years) <br> **Impact:** Medium to high | Extreme precipitation events, such as one-day maximum rainfall and a number of days with heavy rainfall, are likely to increase the probability of floods, causing damage to ThaiBev’s assets and increasing costs of production due to supply-chain disruptions. | ThaiBev conducted flood risk assessment in areas prone to flooding for all key assets, and highlighted areas that were the most likely to be affected. To mitigate any impacts, ThaiBev constructed flood barriers, storm water draining, or pumping stations in the areas highlighted. <br> Further, alternative transportation routes have been planned to minimize supply-chain disruption due to potential floods. <br> Each production site monitors the weather forecast, including the storm and earthquake reports from the Thai Meteorological Department, to receive the earliest warnings. All production sites ensure that the external roofing or solar rooftop systems are in adequate condition and implement response mechanisms to reduce impacts during storms. |
| Storms <br> **Timeframe:** Medium term (3-10 years) <br> **Impact:** Medium to high | Greater probability of disruptions within the operations, the supply chain, and finished goods inventory due to storms. | |
| **Chronic** | | |
| Water stress <br> **Timeframe:** Long term (>10 years) <br> **Impact:** Medium to high | Changes in water availability can affect ThaiBev’s production lines, supply chain, and revenue, especially when factories operate in high water-stress areas. | ThaiBev has initiated Water Sustainability Assessments (WSA) for both surface water and groundwater to receive an in-depth assessment of present and future risks and opportunities. <br> This assessment has led to the development of an Integrated Water Resources Management Plan (IWRM) for each assessed factory, focusing on implementing a long-term adaptation and mitigation plan. |
| Seawater intrusion <br> **Timeframe:** Long term (>10 years) <br> **Impact:** Low to medium (for coastal locations) | Seawater intrusion into natural water sources such as rivers and aquifers can cause disruptions to ThaiBev’s production, leading to more spending on the operational cost of buying fresh water. | Seawater intrusion in aquifers: ThaiBev will engage with local communities and governmental authorities near the identified high-risk areas to improve the groundwater wells. <br> Seawater intrusion into rivers: ThaiBev will expand freshwater stock facilities and implement a management plan to ensure sufficient fresh water supply, by using water-saving technology, water-recycling systems, and rainwater harvesting systems. |
| Increasing temperature <br> **Timeframe:** Long term (>10 years) <br> **Impact:** Low to medium | Changes in air temperature will decrease crop yields throughout ThaiBev’s supply chain, which may cause a higher cost of material sourcing. | ThaiBev has continued to educate farmers to help conserve resources, prepare for natural disasters, and adopt technology for production efficiency. |

# Transition Risk and Opportunity Analysis

ThaiBev has conducted a scenario analysis for transition risks and opportunities, covering two scenarios from the IEA and assessing five drivers over two main time horizons, 2030 and 2050, to evaluate the financial impact of key drivers on our organization, as shown below.

## ThaiBev Transition Risk and Opportunity Scenario Analysis

| **Purpose** | To analyze whether transition-related drivers (policy/legal, market, technology, reputation) will have a significant impact on ThaiBev’s business in the future, and what risk-mitigation actions are required for significant risks. |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scenarios** | - IEA STEPS: the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario, which expects a 2.5–3.3°C rise in global temperatures by 2100. This scenario acts as a base case for transition scenario analysis. <br> - IEA SDS: the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which aligns with a global trajectory that meets the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, forecasting a well-below 2°C rise in global temperatures, with efforts to limit the rise to 1.5°C by 2100. |
| **Scenario time horizons** | - 2030 (near-term): covering "short-term" and "medium-term" timeframes <br> - 2050 (long-term): covering the "long-term" timeframe <br> These scenario time horizons are aligned with ThaiBev’s timeframes for risk and opportunity identification. |
| **Target area of analysis** | Operations and value chain |
| **Scope of financial impact calculations** | ThaiBev Group |

ThaiBev identified a list of relevant transition risks and opportunities to be used in the scenario analysis, as shown below.

| **Risk Category** | **Opportunity Category** |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Policy and Legal** | **Technology Advances** |
| Water Tariff: possibility of increased production costs of beverage products caused by an increased water tariff in Thailand | Material Circularity: increasing financial feasibility of recycling technologies where recycled materials become cheaper than virgin materials. |
| Carbon Pricing (operational and upstream): carbon pricing policies that are already in place in markets of ThaiBev’s supply chain and expected policies in operational areas. | Resource Efficiency: utilizing / investing in energy efficient and emissions reduction technologies / machineries to potentially reduce future costs. |
| **Market Changes** | **Market Changes** |
| Consumer Trends on Low Carbon Products: changing consumer and market preferences towards products seen as better for the environment. | Development of Low-carbon Products: ThaiBev increasing the share of products that receive an approval for the Carbon Footprint of Products and Carbon Footprint Reduction Label |
| **Technology Advances** | Reducing Costs of Renewable Electricity: due to increased demand from the marketplace and economies of scale while investing in these materials. |
| Low Carbon Refrigerants: emergence of new refrigerants with lower global warming potential to replace existing refrigerants – however, no material risk from high emission refrigerants and climate-related reputation is identified due to less exposure and usage. | **Reputation** |
| | Stakeholder Sentiment: increased stakeholder expectations on climate action, especially investors, shareholders, consumers, and societal expectations. |

# 3. Risk Management

ThaiBev has integrated climate-related risks into its multi-disciplinary, company-wide, risk management process, through five steps covering the assessment of size and scope of identified risks.

The identified risks are ranked, assessed, scoped, and monitored by the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC). This committee is responsible for ensuring sound risk and sustainability management, by monitoring possible impacts of climate change on company operations, planning, and taking actions to mitigate these risks. To ensure comprehensive oversight and group-wide monitoring, climate-related risk management is embedded into ThaiBev’s overall risk management process. For an overview of roles and responsibilities related to climate-related issues, please see the diagram below.

## Risk Management Process Relevant to Climate-related Risks and Opportunities

| Objective Setting | Business Risks/Opportunities Identification | Risks/Opportunities Assessment | Risks Control/Treatment and Opportunity Exploitation | Risk Management Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| - Incorporation of climate change as one of the material risks which needs attention  | - Risks and opportunities are identified through research and stakeholder engagement (See “stakeholder engagement”) | - Risks are assessed by comparing with the risk appetite, covering financial impact risks and opportunities prioritization | - Determination of countermeasures, risk indicators, and KPIs | - Monitoring of risks identified through the use of proper indication and collaboration of data collection between each function |
| - Assignment of responsibilities within each function for climate risk management | - Existing and emerging climate-related regulatory and frameworks review (e.g., Thailand carbon pricing, EU carbon pricing) | - Size and scope of the impacts identification through internal engagement based on ThaiBev corporate risk metrics. (See “Assessment of ThaiBev’s key sustainability issues”) | | - Report on climate risks to the BoD and Audit Committee |
| | - Periodic scenario analysis review | - Scenario analysis is updated as needed | | - All functions report to SRMC on ad hoc basis |

# 4. Metrics and Targets

ThaiBev utilizes its own environmental data collection tool across the ThaiBev Group to ensure standardized data collection and calculation. This tool collects energy, emissions, water, wastewater, waste, and environmental compliance data.

The tool quantifies the following **Scope 1 GHG emissions** activities:
- Stationary combustion (including biogenic emissions)
- Mobile combustion (including biogenic emissions)
- Biogas flaring
- CO₂ from carbonation (direct emissions)
- Fugitive emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆)
- Fugitive emissions from wastewater treatment

The tool quantifies the following **Scope 2 GHG emissions** activities:
- Location-based emissions from grid electricity consumption
- Market-based emissions from other electricity provider

Gases included in our inventory are CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, HFCs, and SF₆; PFCs and NF₃ are not relevant to our operations. ThaiBev uses emission factors from the 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). For energy conversions, Net Calorific Values (NCVs) sourced from the IPCC and Thailand’s Ministry of Energy were used. Global warming potentials (100-year) from the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, 2022, were used. Our GHG data undergoes annual third-party assurance as part of our sustainability reporting process (see page 214 of this report).

# Climate Change

ThaiBev’s operating plants measure ozone-depleting substances, CO, NOx, and SOx, including Total Suspended Particles (TSP) from boiler stacks every six months, in compliance with the regulations of the Industrial Works Department, at the Ministry of Industry.

ThaiBev has long collaborated with suppliers and business partners to reduce **Scope 3 GHG emissions**, through application of the CROSS Procurement solution with the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) system. Given ThaiBev’s commitment to the 1.5–2°C temperature limit this century, we have expanded our GHG accounting to all material Scope 3 emission categories based on the GHG Protocol. A screening assessment of relevant Scope 3 GHG emission categories was first performed in FY 2019. ThaiBev began accounting for public disclosure for the first time in FY 2021, allowing a base year to be set and incorporation of the Scope 3 GHG emissions total into ThaiBev’s target of net-zero Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050.

Other climate-related metrics and targets for energy, water, waste and post-consumption packaging management can be found in this report.

# Key Projects

## Internal Carbon Pricing

To accelerate the reduction of own emissions and drive low-carbon investment within the company, ThaiBev uses ICP (Internal Carbon Price) to understand how the carbon value of the company's full carbon footprint is relative to the overall operation costs, profit margins, and company turnover; and to calculate the potential impacts of carbon emissions on its business and activities, including risks and opportunities to build resilience against climate risk and investing in low-carbon technology. ThaiBev will apply ICP as shadow pricing to support CAPEX investment decisions in green projects and avoid CAPEX investment decisions in high-emission projects. ThaiBev’s implementation strategy for ICP is to use the ICP of 20 USD/tCO₂e for investment of more than 10 million Baht per project during 2020–2024 and 32 USD/tCO₂e for project investment of more than 5 million Baht during 2025–2030.

## Climate-related Engagement with Other Partners in the Value Chain

ThaiBev launched its annual Business Partner Award in 2016, with the objective of promoting supplier development, private-sector competitiveness, and sustainable business practices and innovations.

The program contenders are selected based on the following criteria:

- High-volume suppliers, as they may potentially pose higher environmental impacts, including carbon emissions, in the supply chain
- Critical suppliers, as they have significant impacts on ThaiBev’s business and are treated as a high-priority group whose ESG compliance with ThaiBev’s requirements is strictly monitored
- Suppliers with a strong business relationship whose business and sustainability commitments align with ThaiBev’s, as they are the key influencers in driving positive ESG impacts in other tiers down the supply chain, i.e. non-tier 1 suppliers.

In addition, to ensure that awards opportunities are given equally to a diverse group of suppliers, suppliers from various industries are invited to participate in this program, e.g. packaging, commodities, construction, machinery, and service.

# Achievements

## Low Carbon Products

ThaiBev has installed solar panels at 23 plants in Thailand, aiming for full coverage by 2025. Phases 1 and 2 include installations in spirit factories, breweries, non-alcoholic beverage factories, and a food factory, totaling 18.96 Megawatts. This reduces electricity costs by 57.68 million Baht per year and lowers GHG emissions by 7,721 tCO₂e in FY2022.

In 2022, Phase 3 began to expand solar panel installations in Thailand and Myanmar, with floating panels at breweries. The goal is 13.48 MWp, saving 81 million Baht annually and reducing GHG emissions by 9,739 tCO₂e per year. The project investment is approximately 368 million Baht, expected to complete in FY2023.

### Biogas Plant Project in Thailand

In 2022, ThaiBev installed seven biogas plants using vinasse from alcohol distillation. These plants produce 479,678.346 Megajoules (MJ) of thermal energy, reducing fuel oil consumption by 11.87 million litres per year, saving 233 million Baht. They also reduced GHG emissions by 37,244 tCO₂e. Excess biogas generates 55,176 Megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity for local grids.

In 2023, an additional biogas plant will be installed in Ratchaburi province with a 160 million Baht investment, reducing heavy fuel oil consumption for steam production by 1.77 million litres and cutting GHG emissions by 57,193 tCO₂e per year.

# Energy Management

## Once-through Boilers

Many spirits, beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and food factories have installed once-through boilers to increase energy efficiency and decrease the use of non-renewable fuels. These initiatives reduce fuel oil usage by 1.38 million liters per year, equivalent to 27.03 million Baht, and coal usage by 1.68 tonnes per year, equivalent to 7.23 million Baht. GHG emissions are also lowered by 8,470 tCO₂e per year.

## Can to Can

Thai Beverage Recycle (TBR) collects and forwards cans to aluminum sheet manufacturers for recycling in the can production process. In 2022, TBR collected 2,945 tonnes of disposed cans, equivalent to 45% of total can products sold by ThaiBev. This reduces GHG emissions by 4.5 tCO₂e per tonne of aluminum in the can production process when compared to using virgin aluminum.

**In 2022, the proportion of recycled materials used in the production of ThaiBev aluminum cans was about 72%.**

## Key Projects

### Gas Engines

In 2022, the factory under the Spirits Business Group started installing gas engines to generate electricity by using excess biogas from steam production. This can reduce electricity purchased from the local grid by approximately 2,487 Megawatts per year and lower GHG emissions. The project is expected to be completed in 2023, with a total capital expenditure of approximately 18.57 million Baht.

# Water Stewardship

The world’s water resources are increasingly in crisis. Water shortages, floods, and pollution are affecting livelihoods on a more acute scale. As water is a key element of ThaiBev’s operations, we have highlighted water-related risk as part of our climate-change risks.

Recognizing that water quality and scarcity will have an impact in both short and long terms, ThaiBev focuses on sustainable water management practices throughout the value chain. We have implemented assessment tools and innovative projects at both factory and community levels, as well as setting clear water replenishment targets. ThaiBev aims to maximize water efficiency, maintain clean water standards, and protect important watersheds across the country. We are committed to fulfill our long-term Corporate Water Management Policy, which aims to balance economic, social, and environmental requirements with the long-term protection of water resources. Through this commitment, ThaiBev continues to take into account the interests of water users on the principle of equal rights.

# Management Approach

Water is an essential natural resource for ThaiBev’s production process. The demand for water continues to increase, but its availability is decreasing due to degradation of water sources, water pollution, and the effects of climate change. ThaiBev recognizes the importance of water conservation to maintain high water quality and ensure sufficient quantity for production, while minimizing the impact on communities. Thus, the company has identified water management as one of its key material issues which serves to enhance ThaiBev’s climate resilience. The company manages its water-related issues with the following actions:

## 1. Identifying risks and opportunities

ThaiBev adheres to its Corporate Water Management Policy in order to manage risks related to water. The company regularly conducts an analysis of water-related risks that may result from climate change, including uneven and less predictable rainfall, changes in spatial distribution of the rainfall, and decrease in rainfall volume. Additionally, water quality is at risk due to the intrusion of seawater into the surface water during the dry season. ThaiBev reviews its physical risk assessment related to water at all its production facilities every three to five years, in order to understand potential risks and to prepare for the impacts of climate change. This enables each facility to develop appropriate water-related risk management plans and mitigation measures.

## 2. Risk monitoring

A monitoring system and assessment programs have been established to closely monitor the quantity and quality of water in order to mitigate any possible impacts. ThaiBev monitors integrated water data through the National Hydroinformatics Data Center (NHC) and compares this on a monthly basis against its own data. In addition, a working group at each production facility consistently engages with both internal and external stakeholders, especially communities and local authorities, to collect their feedback about plant operations as well as to respond to any concerns.

Potential water-related issues are reported to the Product Group’s risk coordinators for mitigation plans and improvement initiatives on a monthly basis. Any material water-related risks posed by water scarcity and quality are reported to executives and the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC) for further mitigation measures for both short and long terms.

# Water Stewardship

ThaiBev focuses on ensuring that all production facilities are certified with the international standards for environmental management (ISO 14001: 2015). In terms of controlling the standards of effluent discharge, the company treats wastewater to a higher quality standard than legal requirements before releasing it into the water source, to ensure minimal impact on the ecosystem.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

| Reduction | Replenish |
|-----------|-----------|
| 5% water intensity by 2025 compared to 2019 | 100% water used in finished goods by 2040 |

**All factories in Thailand to complete a Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA) by 2023**

## 2022 Highlight

### Water Resources Management for the Community

ThaiBev has joined forces with the national Hydro-Informatics Institute (HII) in a "Water Resources Management for the Community" project, to study and assess the risks of floods and droughts in both short and long terms, by using the HII’s Water Resource Information System for Sustainable Development. The first project covers a radius of five kilometers around the Beer Thai Brewery in Kamphang Phet province, which is located in the Lower Ping Basin area (downstream of the confluence of the Ping and Wang rivers). The study process is as follows:

1. Study the general condition of the area, the watershed condition, and meteorological and hydrological data, including sources that may cause water pollution, in order to assess the flooding and drought situation and the history of such events in the past.
2. Site-survey and interview people in the areas both upstream and downstream to explore the size and direction of the river’s flow, and previous flooded areas, including the extent of flooding.
3. Analyze flood risk through computer-modelled flood simulations; use the scenarios to design a flood graph with recurrence cycles of 10, 25, 50 and 100 years.
4. Analyze drought risk through the Drought Risk Index (DRI), using the Potential Surface Analysis (PSA) from the 10-year recurring drought statistics and the 30-year rainfall data during the dry season or from November to April.

The results showed that the study area as a whole is at low risk of flooding and drought; only about 3% of the area is at high drought risk. High-risk areas are at risk of droughts during December, January and March due to minimal rainfall, which can result in insufficient water to meet production and community demand.

ThaiBev will continue to monitor and plan its water management for the Beer Thai Brewery, even though the area is not categorized as "extremely high water stress" as described by the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Global Water Tool. This will be a prototype project that can be extended to support local communities’ water resources management at other production facilities which are located in "high to extremely-high water stress" areas (accounting for 45.2% of total facilities). With this initiative, ThaiBev will be able to operate its business and create value for the communities that share the same water sources.

# Key Projects

## Organizations of Water Users

Thailand’s Office of National Water Resources (ONWR) has organized a collaborative effort called “Organizations of Water Users”, which brings together the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors to develop better management of the country’s water resources. This significant initiative encourages the different sectors to work together in solving water-related problems such as floods and droughts.

ThaiBev’s representatives are members of the Organizations of Water Users for 12 out of the 22 watersheds across the country. The role of the Organizations of Water Users is to execute the proper use, development, and management of water resources and to carry out the maintenance, restoration, and conservation of water resources in their respective watersheds. The members of these organizations also have the opportunity to elect a watershed committee in their area. In 2022, ThaiBev’s representatives were selected as industry representatives for two watersheds, the Tha Chin River watershed and the Ping River watershed.

ThaiBev hopes that its active participation in this important new collaboration will help to alleviate problems related to floods, droughts, and water quality. In addition, the company hopes that increased participation in national water policies will further embed efficient and sustainable water management practices in the country for a healthier environment and society.

ThaiBev’s watershed committee representatives will participate in the Federation of Thai Industries’ water management committee meeting, as part of the FTI’s involvement with the Office of National Water Resources in the direction of national water management. This participation will help the company manage water efficiently and sustainably in accordance with the country’s 20-year water resource management plan and prepare for any changes in policy.

## Surface Water and Groundwater Assessment Projects

ThaiBev continues to conduct Water Sustainability Assessments (WSA) covering both surface and groundwater sources at its production facilities, to identify potential impacts and risks to the business. These in-depth assessments cover four dimensions:

1. Detailed water resources assessment, including the availability of water sources and the internal structure of water resources
2. The vulnerability of the watershed, considering both social and environmental factors
3. Water-related natural disasters such as droughts and floods
4. The quality of water sources

These assessments cover a period of five years to ensure there are sustainable water supplies to support the facilities’ operations. Processes in the study include water sufficiency, water quality, rules and regulations related to water resources, and stakeholders’ perceptions.

In 2022, the company completed water sustainability assessments for both surface and groundwater for 27 factories and plans to expand the assessments to cover all factories in Thailand by 2023.

## Wastewater Management through Artificial Wetlands

The Knockdhu Distillery Company Ltd, ThaiBev’s subsidiary in Scotland, has further extended its commitment to sustainability by developing artificial wetlands as a treatment system for the liquid residue left after its distillation process; this consists of six separate, aggregate-filled, Bentomat-lined cells, working in two pairs of three cells. With a surface area of 2,000 square meters, the wetlands are home to 21,000 plants of 17 different species. The system, which has support from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, has proved to be highly successful at copper removal, pH correction, and removal of both COD and BOD, taking off the road each week 8-10 bulk tankers (each with a 25,000-litre capacity) and resulting in a carbon reduction of approximately 40 tonnes per annum. In addition, the wetlands have become a haven for insects, small mammals, birds, and bats.

# Water Stewardship

## Water Footprint (WFP)

ThaiBev has received a water footprint (WFP) assessment certification from the Water and Environment Institute for Sustainability (Federation of Thai Industries) for OISHI Green Tea, honey-infused with lemon (380 ml). This product uses the principles of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), starting from raw material acquisition, through the manufacturing process, to the disposal of product debris after use. Evaluation is by unit of water used per unit of product (liter/1 unit of product). The assessment can also be in the form of water scarcity footprint, as a guideline for the product’s water management and to improve efficiency in using water resources to the maximum.

## Projects with Local Communities

ThaiBev has implemented several projects that aim to help conserve upstream forests and watersheds and protect water sources that are vital to local communities. Here are some showcase examples of ThaiBev’s community water management activities.

### Sharing Water with the Community

In 2022, ThaiBev continued its commitment to ensuring local communities and the agricultural sector receive clean water. The Spirits Product Group initiated a CSR activity “Sharing Water with the Community”, in which the factories in Prachinburi and Surat Thani provinces helped release clean water to more than 50 neighboring communities.

### Clean Drinking Water for Children and Communities

ThaiBev has continued its initiative to ensure local communities, especially children, receive clean drinking water, by expanding the “Clean Drinking Water” project in schools and communities around its factories. ThaiBev’s representatives provide basic training about maintenance and cleaning of the water filtration system, so that school students always have clean, hygienic drinking water that meets quality standards. In 2022, more than 3,000 children and adults gained access to clean drinking water in communities in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Pathum Thani, Chonburi, Nakhon Pathom, Kanchanaburi, Ubon Ratchathani and Surat Thani provinces.

## The “Klong Suay Nam Sai Pracha Ruam Jai” Project

SangSom Co., Ltd., our spirit factory in Nakhon Pathom Province, in collaboration with Hom Kret Subdistrict, Nakhon Pathom Province, and the surrounding communities, organized the “Klong Suay Nam Sai Pracha Ruam Jai” project. It aimed to create participation among people in the community in conserving natural water resources, restoring water quality in canals, as well as in solving the problem of water spoilage in public bodies of water. A similar project has been implemented at Red Bull Distillery (1988) Co., Ltd in Samut Sakhon Province as well.

## Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels

To encourage the industrial sector to share its social responsibilities by developing and conserving groundwater, the Water and Environment Institute of Sustainability under the Federation of Thai Industries and the Department of Ground Resources organized a program called “Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels”. The aim is to encourage industrial factories to develop underground water storage (with a depth of not more than 15 meters) on their empty spaces for rainwater collection, which will work as a back-up water source and add moisture to the ground especially in areas that are prone to drought.

Nine of ThaiBev’s factories were selected by the Federation of Thai Industries to participate, in Pathum Thani, Nakhon Sawan, Kamphaeng Phet, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Buriram, Chonburi, and Surat Thani provinces. The project will act as a model for factories, showing them how to harvest rainwater and conserve shallow underground water without affecting the ecosystem and the environment. ThaiBev is working on expanding the project to cover more locations nationwide. This project is significant for featuring the collaborative participation of the government, the industrial sector and local communities.

# Packaging and Circular Economy

The world increasingly recognizes the importance of maximizing resource efficiency and transitioning to a circular economy. In Thailand, the Bio-Circular-Green Model (BCG) has been promoted by the government as a new economic model for inclusive and sustainable growth. Applying circular economy principles throughout its value chain, ThaiBev has developed a closed-loop packaging collection system to create new recycling opportunities post-consumption, as another way of increasing resource efficiency and reducing waste, especially with primary packaging materials such as glass, paper, aluminum cans, and PET bottles. Thai Beverage Recycle (TBR), a ThaiBev subsidiary, is dedicated to managing post-consumption packaging.

We believe that increasing circularity, reducing GHG emissions through materials efficiency, and the proper handling of company-related packaging waste will be beneficial to all stakeholders, the environment, and human rights. Hence, ThaiBev works with stakeholders throughout our value chain, including tier 1 and non-tier 1 suppliers, small business owners, and consumers, to optimize packaging efficiency and create value for post-consumption packaging through the circular economy model.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev aims to achieve packaging circularity, taking into account all environmental as well as social impacts. The company integrates the circular economy concept into its entire packaging value chain, from design stage to post-consumption packaging management. The key elements of ThaiBev’s management approach towards packaging circularity are:

1. **Optimization of Packaging Weight and Volume**

   ThaiBev works with suppliers to design and develop packaging that uses fewer natural resources while maintaining quality and functionality. As part of a group-wide commitment, ThaiBev has successfully downgauged aluminum cans and reduced the amount of aluminum used in can packaging by 600 tonnes compared to 2020. Overall, in FY2022, ThaiBev successfully optimized the weight of multiple packaging materials, resulting in a reduction of more than 1,000 tonnes of materials.

2. **Post-consumption Packaging Collection and Sorting**

   TBR is responsible for retrieving ThaiBev’s post-consumption packaging from business partners throughout the country and sorting them at company-owned sorting facilities. The main packaging materials retrieved by TBR are glass, cullet, aluminum cans, PET bottles, and corrugated cartons. In FY2022, TBR expanded into the HDPE collection business and retrieved 103 tonnes of post-consumption HDPE bottles for recycling.

3. **Reuse and Recycle**

   In order to ensure efficient closed-loop post-consumption packaging management, TBR collaborates with partners throughout the packaging value chain including local collectors and recyclers. Through this collaboration, ThaiBev is able to create closed-loop schemes especially for our main packaging materials: glass, paper, PET bottles, and aluminum cans. In response to Thailand’s new legislation allowing the use of recycled plastic in food contact packaging, ThaiBev has been working with partners to study the feasibility of using recycled PET (rPET) and has set a target of using 30% rPET in PET bottles by 2030.

4. **Innovation and Product Design for Sustainable Packaging**

   ThaiBev established BevTech Co., Ltd. (BevTech) as a research and development center that develops sustainable packaging and alternatives. BevTech also researches machines and robotics to facilitate automation in ThaiBev’s production facilities. BevTech has successfully implemented an automated bottle-sorting conveyor belt equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) bottle-sorting technology, through collaboration with CMKL University, a top-tier research institute established as a collaboration between King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the world’s leading university on AI technology.

5. **Stakeholder Collaboration**

   ThaiBev engages with stakeholders throughout its value chain to ensure end-to-end sustainable packaging management. It also works closely with TIPMSE (Thailand Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for a Sustainable Environment) of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). In 2022, ThaiBev’s Chief Non-Alcoholic Beverage Business and Chief Supply Chain Management Thailand were assigned as President and Vice President, respectively, on the TIPMSE Executive Board. As one of the co-founders of the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN), ThaiBev has also been actively engaging with other TSCN co-founders to drive sustainable packaging management in Thailand.

# 2022 Highlight

![Image of an event with participants holding signs related to the PACKBACK program]

TIPMSE, in collaboration with the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, held an event to honor the 72 organizations participating in the PACKBACK program.

## Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

ThaiBev has been actively supporting TIPMSE in developing the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme in Thailand. EPR principles are included in Thailand’s Plastic Waste Management Plan for 2019-2030 and the national agenda of resource management in the circular economy as part of the BCG Economic Model. Under the EPR concept, producers are responsible for the environmental impacts of their products and packaging, throughout their entire life cycle, including the post-consumption stage.

In December 2021, ThaiBev and its subsidiaries, OISHI and Sermsuk, along with other leading companies in Thailand, joined a consortium in ‘The Intention Declaration of Extended Producer Responsibility’ to drive EPR through the PACKBACK program. Endorsed by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI), the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and the Ministry of Interior, the program has successfully been applied on a pilot scale in Chonburi province, Thailand, since January 2022. The program engages more than 70 parties including producers, retailers, recyclers, local government organizations, and research institutes in demonstrating the potential of EPR for the management of packaging waste. TBR, as one of the major drivers of the program, is in charge of project management in Chonburi province, and is collecting data on glass recycling to support the development of a national packaging database. The pilot phase of the PACKBACK program focuses on post-consumption management of seven packaging materials, namely glass, aluminum cans, corrugated carton, UHT drink cartons, PET, HDPE, and multilayer packaging.

The PACKBACK initiative was highlighted at the week-long Sustainability Expo (SX) 2022, one of the largest sustainability events in Southeast Asia, attracting more than 200,000 participants. TBR and TIPMSE had installed more than 20 recycling stations with bins to separate the seven packaging materials throughout the event. Concurrent with SX2022, TIPMSE, in collaboration with the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, held an event to honor the 72 organizations participating in the PACKBACK program. As a keynote speaker, the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment gave an inaugural speech on the topic, “Driving towards packaging management in accordance with the circular economy through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)”.

# Key Projects

## Bring Back-Recycle

TBR launched the Bring Back-Recycle program in FY 2019 to encourage end users to be a part of post-consumption packaging management. Starting off as an internal recycling campaign, the program has expanded to 16 locations in Bangkok. The impacts of this program are being tracked by OK Recycle, a smartphone application which uses demand-and-supply matching mechanisms to connect end users to recyclers.

Under the Bring Back-Recycle program, TBR also collaborated with multiple partners in order to create awareness of post-consumption recycling among consumers:

- **Sermsuk Public Company Limited**, the manufacturer and distributor of Crystal drinking water, has launched “Crystal water bottles for the world” to promote responsible consumption among all consumer groups, especially adolescents and children. Upcycling stations have been set up at 28 schools country-wide to support the collection and separation of PET bottles, which are retrieved by TBR for recycling or upcycling.

- In collaboration with **Water Festival Thailand** and **ThaiBev’s Smiling Communities initiative**, TBR has held a “Sufficient Community for Sustainable World” activity for two consecutive years, creating a sustainable recycling loop through waste separation at community level. The program has so far reached many communities in 5 provinces.

- For three years in a row, TBR has installed recycling stations for PET bottles at the Buriram Marathon, one of the largest such events in Thailand, attracting more than 20,000 runners annually. Six thousand PET bottles were collected at Buriram Marathon 2022. TBR has also organized an interactive recycling game to educate consumers about post-consumption packaging recycling.

- In 2022, TBR installed waste recycling stations throughout Sustainability Expo (SX). A one-of-a-kind Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) that can collect glass bottles, aluminum cans, and PET bottles was also installed at ThaiBev’s booth in the main exhibition zone. And to highlight one of the most successful efforts to create awareness, ThaiBev invited participants to collect 38 post-consumption PET bottles to exchange for a green PET blanket. These same blankets are donated annually under “ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold”, a community development project of 23 years’ standing. More than 42,000 PET bottles were collected through this activity.

## Group-wide Packaging Assessment

In order to gain better understanding of packaging materials in ThaiBev’s portfolio, TBR collaborated with Product Groups to conduct a group-wide Packaging Assessment. The objective of the assessment was to conduct a feasibility study for collecting and recycling of post-consumption packaging. The assessment was conducted through interviews with stakeholders, site visits to recycling and manufacturing facilities, and desk research. Each packaging component was graded in terms of collection rate and recycling rate. Recommendations had been made to Product Groups to improve recyclability of their packaging, along with recyclability questionnaire for new products development.

## OASIS

OASIS is a digital area management tool that uses big data to identify opportunities to increase the collection rate of used glass bottles. This is done by using data analytics, taking into account multiple parameters: sales volume, logistics, purchase of used bottles, suppliers’ information and population density. Through the analysis, ThaiBev is able to identify new bottle collectors in strategic locations and utilizes backhaul logistics to collect used glass bottles. After a month-long pilot, OASIS had increased the collection rate by 4% compared to the same month in the last fiscal year.

# Aluminum Can Closed-Loop Recycling

To further ThaiBev’s commitment to ensuring that recyclable packaging is actually recycled, TBR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on “Transparency of Aluminum Can Closed-Loop Recycling”, which aims to establish a fully integrated recycling system for used aluminum cans in Thailand through supply chain collaboration. The objectives are to improve the efficiency of the recycling process, the recycling rate, and the proportion of recycled content in aluminum cans. An “Aluminum Loop” symbol was designed to create awareness among consumers and is displayed on many product brands including ThaiBev’s popular soft drink products: Chakuza and est cola. The campaign is an example of how manufacturers and brand owners can collaborate with partners along the supply chain, and influence the demand for recycled packaging, thus boosting the recycling rate. In 2022, 1,305 tonnes or 95 million aluminum cans were retrieved through this campaign, and the average recycled content of aluminum cans currently used by ThaiBev is 72%.

## Achievements

### Retrieval Rate in FY2022

| Material       | Quantity         | Representation                          |

| Glass          | 1,260 million bottles | 84% of products sold in Thailand         |
| Cullet         | 240,154 tonnes   |                                         |
| Aluminum can   | 2,945 tonnes     | 45% of products sold in Thailand         |
| Paper          | 104,610 tonnes   | 167% of paper packaging used in Thailand |
| PET            | 8,214 tonnes     | 21% of products sold in Thailand         |

- **Reduced raw materials in aluminum can production by 600 tonnes compared to 2020 as a base year.**

# Waste Management

Waste disposal is a global environmental problem. Waste to landfill has dangerous effects on human health and the environment. The generation of leachate can contaminate groundwater and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is produced. In 2021, around 31.6% of all waste generated in Thailand went to landfill.

Since landfill is the least preferable option, ThaiBev is committed to reducing solid waste to landfill from its production facilities to the necessary minimum or zero. The aim is to lessen the waste-related impacts on the environment and on the living conditions of neighboring communities, including their basic right to have access to resources such as clean air and clean water.

ThaiBev aims to optimize resource utilization throughout the value chain, by collaborating with stakeholders to adopt the 3Rs principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Waste management initiatives include post-consumption packaging management, using waste products to generate energy, and managing by-products.

# Management Approach

Recognizing its responsibility to communities, society, and the environment, ThaiBev has implemented a waste hierarchy system on the circular economy principle, emphasizing reuse, re-manufacturing, and recycling, to prevent and mitigate waste-related impacts.

## Waste Hierarchy

| Most preferable       |
|-----------------------|
| Avoid and reduce waste|
| Reuse waste           |
| Upcycle and recycle waste |
| Recover energy        |
| Treat waste           |
| Landfill              |
| Least preferable      |

ThaiBev increases the value of waste and by-products by using them as raw materials in the agricultural and industrial sectors to further reduce the use of chemicals. Examples include using malt residue and grain residue from alcohol production as ingredients in livestock feed, and using effluent from the vinasse treatment process as a soil conditioner in the growing of crops such as sugarcane, rice, cassava, and oil palm.

The company also encourages and trains employees to prevent waste by using the tools of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and to participate in waste management programs that promote environmental sustainability.

ThaiBev has implemented both Waste Inventory System (WIN) and Sustainability Data Management System (SDMS) software to collect and process data from relevant Product Groups/Business Units and suppliers, including the quantity and type of waste generated and its disposal method. This company-wide information is shown to all business units and makes them aware of the waste reduction needed to meet ThaiBev’s goal of zero waste to landfill by 2040.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

# Waste Management

## 2022 Highlight

### Granular Ash as Soil Improver/Conditioner

Powdered ash is the waste generated from evaporation and incineration of vinasse, effluent from the distillation process, to produce steam for internal use. At present, powdered ash is sold as an ingredient to fertilizer manufacturers due to its nutrient value to plants. However, sales of powdered ash from the production facility are slow, with some portion being kept in stock that may have to be disposed of to landfill.

In order to solve the problem, ThaiBev has innovated a new product, granular ash, for fertilizer manufacturers. It is more convenient to use as a soil improver/conditioner and no landfill is required. In 2022, granular ash’s sales volume increased to 35% of the total of powdered ash (5,000 tonnes).

## Key Projects

### Malt Dust for Agriculture

Malt is the primary raw material used in ThaiBev’s beer and spirit production processes. As well as malt residue, a by-product of the manufacturing process that has many nutritional benefits and is suitable for agricultural use, malt dust has nutritional value as animal feed and would otherwise go to waste.

In 2022, the distillery in Kamphaeng Phet Province signed an MOU with Mae Lad sub-district administration in Klong Khlung District to supply 14,000 kilograms of malt dust for distribution to the communities as animal feed. The other spirit distillery in Samut Sakhon Province offered malt dust to local farmers for aquaculture feed, which helps the community reduce aquafarming costs, increase productivity, and generate sustainable income.

### Encouraging Employees to Participate in Waste Reduction by Separating Waste

To reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and promote the most efficient use of resources through the 3Rs principle, ThaiBev’s production facilities have launched a campaign to create awareness among employees about the benefits of waste separation and the value that can be added to recyclable waste. The results of the campaign are as follows:

- Reduction of waste within the factories and to landfill
- Ability to recycle waste for other uses
- Creating teamwork among employees
- Reducing costs and adding value to waste
- Reducing waste-related impacts and protecting the environment

# Food Loss and Waste

According to the United Nations, at least one-third of all food, by weight, is lost or wasted. Globally, this has significant environmental impacts and is a factor driving climate change, since waste that decomposes in landfills generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has estimated that 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with unconsumed food. To help address this problem, ThaiBev is working to reduce its food loss and waste inventories and ensure that resources are used more efficiently to minimize the company’s environmental impacts.

# Management Approach

Target 12.3 of the UN SDGs calls for halving food loss and waste per capita by 2030. ThaiBev has set a similar but more ambitious goal: to eliminate food loss and waste discarded to landfills to zero by 2030. This means that by 2030, all food loss and waste generated by the company will be purposely used elsewhere. ThaiBev has devised several strategic across four business units (Spirits, Beer, Non-Alcoholic Beverages and Food) to reduce the total volume of food loss and waste generated along the value chain, as well as the volume of food loss and waste discarded. These include selling raw material waste to create animal feed and donating safe and high-quality food surpluses to underprivileged people. Furthermore, the company aims to work with all of its stakeholders to innovatively track and reduce food loss and waste throughout the value chain.

Food loss and food waste have related, but different meanings based on where they occur in the value chain. Food loss is the decreased quantity or quality of food from harvesting, transporting, and production up to – but excluding – the retail level, while food waste occurs at the retail and consumption level. ThaiBev categorizes food loss and waste based on where they occur, using various systems of measurement. At production sites, food loss is accumulated, measured, categorized, and stored before it gets managed. The company records the amount of food loss at production sites, which allows it to trace the loss back to where it occurred. ThaiBev also uses other methods to measure the amount of food loss and waste, including by calculating the weight difference between full and empty truckloads. At the retail level, ThaiBev’s methods to measure food waste include weighing food waste at each restaurant and calculating waste using the inventory system.

## Food Loss and Waste Tracking Process

- **Data Collector (BBF & Restaurants)**
- **Sustainability Data Management System (SDMS)**
- **Data Analyst**
- **Project Management Office (PMO)**

Food loss and waste data is compiled by data collectors (at the food factory in Chonburi province and restaurants), via the online Sustainability Data Management System (SDMS). Data is gathered from relevant departments and suppliers, summarized and analyzed collectively by data analysts and sent to the Project Management Office for further consideration. From the data, there will be more discussions on how to reduce more waste.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero** food loss and waste to landfills by **2030** | Food waste reduction campaign and initiatives will be expanded to cover all ThaiBev restaurant chains. |

### Food Loss

One of ThaiBev’s top priorities is to accurately track and record any losses that occur within its manufacturing processes. The company then analyzes where and why these losses occurred, and develops goals for better management procedures.

Most of the food loss that occurs at the food factory is from the food preparation and manufacturing process. However, with the tracking records in place, ThaiBev can monitor and analyze food loss in detail and minimize the loss accordingly. The online Sustainability Data Management System (SDMS) has been put in place and data collectors at the food factory input data into the program on a continuous basis. Problems or suggestions are relayed to the head of the Project to review and take action. These assessments minimize losses in each process and maximize the reuse of what would otherwise be lost during production.

# Food Loss and Waste

To reduce food loss, the company also works with its suppliers to ensure that raw materials meet quality standards and are not lost due to poor packaging or transport practices.

ThaiBev also manages and sorts food loss according to different categories, while tracking the monthly volume for each waste disposal method. This data is maintained and monitored in order to meet the company's reduction targets. With this system in place, ThaiBev tracks each type of food loss that occurs daily by weight, and looks for ways to reduce these losses effectively.

Most importantly, ThaiBev has collaborated with upstream and downstream partners to create innovative new products and programs to reduce food loss. Among the company’s key innovations are:

- Transforming vegetable waste into fertilizer
- Reutilizing bread crumbs and salmon waste in new food products
- Donating raw material waste to be used as animal feed
- Selling used oil to suppliers to produce biodiesel

## Food Waste

ThaiBev is continuously working to improve data accuracy for food waste, collecting information from its retail stores, such as KFC and Shabushi. The company also works with logistics partners licensed in waste handling to ensure that waste is collected and handled properly. To avoid potential safety and hygiene issues, food waste, which is highly perishable, must be dealt with swiftly. ThaiBev is exploring various methods to create new value-added uses for its food waste, including selling food loss at production plants to pet food or feed manufacturers, and donating surplus food from its restaurant chains to organizations and communities.

## 2022 Highlight

### Zero Food Waste Challenge

Shabushi (Shabu buffet restaurant chain) created the “Kin Mod Kliang” challenge for its customers. “Kin Mod Kliang” means “Eat it all so there’s no food waste.” The slogan reminds people to be considerate and reduce their food waste. Since Shabushi is a buffet style restaurant, the customers can take more food if they want. This campaign raises consumer awareness not to take too much food at one time. The challenge operated in 165 branches across the country (160 branches of Shabushi and 5 branches of Nikuya) and a total of 362,420 customers participated. Awareness of the issue of food waste was well received by customers.

## Key Projects

### KFC Harvest Program

Surplus food is donated directly to people living in disadvantaged circumstances. Currently, the QSR of Asia, or QSA, provides surplus food to 10 vocational institutes across Thailand, including Baan Metta (Nakhon Ratchasima Province), Baan Wangthong (Phitsanulok Province), Baan Rachawadee (Nonthaburi Province), Baan Maharaj (Pathumthani Province), and Baan Tubkwang (Saraburi Province). In 2022, KFC donated 6,319.06 kilograms of high-quality food.

| KFC Harvest | 2021    | 2022    |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Donation (kg.) | 8,454.61 | 6,319.06 |

# KFC Colonel’s Kitchen Project

Food safety and hygiene are vital contributors to one’s quality of life. This project improves the lives of underprivileged people living in homeless shelters by supporting improvements to the shelters’ kitchens. In 2022, we are exploring the Colonel’s Kitchen Project across Thailand.

# Selling used cooking oil to produce biodiesel

In 2022, 1,147.37 tonnes of used cooking oil from restaurants were sold to produce biodiesel. This also served as another source of income, generating around 25.98 million Baht. ThaiBev believes this alternative source of energy could also help mitigate climate change.

# Food surplus donation in collaboration with the Scholars of Sustenance (SOS) foundation

The OISHI Group works with the SOS foundation to donate food surplus to various vulnerable communities. The foundation works with restaurants in different locations, to pick up the food surplus (either raw or cooked). Restaurants are given instructions on how to store the food, including whether containers are necessary, and what food categories are accepted to ensure the safety of those receiving the food. In 2022, the project has expanded into 24 restaurants in the OISHI Group (16 branches of Shabushi, 6 branches of OISHI Buffet and 2 branches of Nikuya). A total of 2,945.01 kilograms of food surplus was donated, which equivalent to 24,277 meals and worth around 298,357.20 baht.

# “Mai Kin Bork, Aow Ork Hai” Campaign (“Tell Us What You Don’t Want”)

Launched on July 1, 2022, at OISHI Ramen, Kakashi, and OISHI Biztoro, this food waste awareness campaign has a simple but strong message. Customers can let staff know about any ingredients for a particular dish that they normally don’t eat, and the staff will tell the chefs not to include them. In this way, customers reduce food waste without any effect on the taste and overall value of the dish.

Staff inform customers about the campaign when they order (along with in-store signage). The food waste reduction volume of this program might not be significant, but it is effective in raising customers’ awareness about the issue.

# Achievements

In 2022 only 690.63 tonnes, or 30.28% of total food loss and waste, was discarded and sent to landfills. This means that the other 69.72%, or approximately 1,596.36 tonnes, was redirected and used for alternative purposes.

- **Food loss and waste donated as animal feed:** 437.84 tonnes
- **Food loss sold as by-products:** 1.89 tonnes
- **Food waste donated:** 9.26 tonnes
- **Food loss and waste sold to produce biodiesel:** 1,147.37 tonnes

# Biodiversity

Global loss of biodiversity is increasingly regarded as one of climate change’s most significant consequences. To make sure ecosystems remain resilient and minimize any disruption to the environmental balance that our society relies on, ThaiBev recognizes biodiversity as a material issue and is committed to create net positive impact on biodiversity across its global operations. As many of ThaiBev’s businesses are located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, ThaiBev fully recognizes the need to be proactive on this issue. ThaiBev has launched biodiversity-related efforts in 2022 by refining its assessment of biodiversity data into a Critical Habitat Assessment for all production sites, with the goal of managing our impact on biodiversity to achieve net positive impact.

# Management Approach

A year ago, ThaiBev announced its commitments to a net positive impact on biodiversity and no gross deforestation in its operations by 2030. These commitments extend to the entire supply chain. ThaiBev expects both tier 1 and non-tier 1 suppliers to avoid having a negative impact on biodiversity and no gross deforestation. ThaiBev has collaborated with external stakeholders such as suppliers, non-governmental organizations, and communities, and will continue to ensure commitments are met. These commitments are consistent with worldwide pledges to reverse nature loss by 2030.

ThaiBev’s commitment to no gross deforestation involves stringent measures and monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance throughout the supply chain, as part of its supplier guidelines, including audits to verify progress towards the commitment. As ThaiBev’s exposure to deforestation within its own direct operations is minimal, such efforts are focused on the supply chain and procurement processes, including expanding awareness regarding biodiversity. ThaiBev has incorporated the mitigation hierarchy into company procedures (Avoid, Minimize, Restore, and Offset) to manage potential biodiversity risks related to production facilities.

The Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC) reviews issues related to potential biodiversity risks quarterly. ThaiBev’s risk coordinators for Product Groups/Key Business Units work with the Corporate Risk Management Working Team to ensure that the mitigation hierarchy is applied and residual impacts are reduced as much as reasonably possible (see ThaiBev’s Sustainability Development and Risk Management Structure in the Annual Report 2022). Any biodiversity-related risk considered material to the Product Groups/Business Units shall be reported to the SRMC for further consideration and action.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

- Net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030
- No gross deforestation in ThaiBev’s operations and its tier 1 critical suppliers for paper packaging and key agricultural commodities by 2030

# 2022 Highlight

## Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA)

ThaiBev further refined its assessment of biodiversity data by conducting a Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA) for 40 locations (42 production sites, 34 in Thailand, 2 in Myanmar, and 6 in Scotland). This involved a closer examination of species against the International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 6 (PS6) on Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources (IFC 2012), with extensive expert consultation and a detailed review to better assess the extent of site development and operations that may have impacts on critical biodiversity. A summary of the CHA results is shown in the table.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2022

According to the Refined Critical Biodiversity Risk Screening, 26 production sites (24 locations) are in proximity to Protected Areas (PA), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA), and Ramsar Convention areas, which can be summarized as follows:

## ThaiBev’s Production Site Information

| Locations including subsurface and underground land | 40 locations in Thailand, Myanmar, and Scotland |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Total size of operational sites                     | 17.7338 km²                                    |
| Relations to protected areas                        | 8 production sites in proximity to Protected Areas<br>22 production sites in proximity to Key Biodiversity Areas<br>1 production site in proximity to a Ramsar Convention area |
| Operations                                          | 42 production sites                            |
| Biodiversity value characterized                    | Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems          |

A number of International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List species were identified in close proximity to some of ThaiBev’s production locations. Among the Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, and Least Concern species are the Club-barbel Sheatfish, the Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle, and the Spoon-billed Sandpiper. However, more research is required to determine how many species are still present or have become locally extinct.

![Chitra chitra (Asian Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle)](image2.jpg)
![Calidris pygmaea (Spoon-billed Sandpiper)](image3.jpg)

ThaiBev will further evaluate the likelihood and severity of impacts, focusing on the 24 locations (26 production sites) with residual risk as identified in the Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA). The following factors will be taken into consideration:

- Impact severity: impact magnitude, duration, extent, plus legal and guideline compliance and the characteristics of the receptor/resource
- Likelihood of occurrence

ThaiBev will further develop its Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP), by identifying and optimizing any practical biodiversity offset near the sites and consulting the stakeholders involved.

# Key Projects

## Community Forest Project with the Mae Fah Luang Foundation

ThaiBev has joined the Mae Fah Luang Foundation's Community Forest Project. The foundation aims to expand community forests across 300,000 rai (48,000 hectares) through the forest carbon credit management mechanism for sustainable development, which aims to integrate rural development with forest preservation to reduce Thailand's greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, ThaiBev and the Mae Fah Luang Foundation started Phase 1 of the project covering 12 community forests with a total area of 13,636 rai (2,181.76 hectares) in four provinces: Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Phayao. In 2022, Phase 2 of the project added 33 more community forests covering a total area of 32,505 rai (5,200.8 hectares) in four provinces: Chiang Mai, Kamphaeng Phet, Uthai Thani, and Krabi. Each phase of the project will take six years to complete.

## Community Forest Project with the Forest in Our Hearts Foundation

ThaiBev collaborates with the Forest in Our Hearts Foundation to conserve the environment and endangered wildlife, and solve pollution problems, by restoring and maintaining forests, and by increasing green space in all areas of Thailand. With the aim of achieving sustainable economic, social and environmental development, the first project was initiated in Chiang Dao District of Chiang Mai Province after it was affected by wildfires in March 2020. A fertile area that's home to Thailand's only semi-alpine plant community, Chiang Dao's mountain, Doi Luang, was designated as the fifth UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Thailand in 2021.

After the wildfires, a community forestation project was started in Ban Mae Ka, covering an area of 107 rai. The objective is for the community, especially young people, to participate in reforestation and seedling heritage activities in their area and public relations activities for the sustainable protection of forests. The president of the foundation together with the committee and the people of Ban Mae Ka, 200 government officials, and 400 students from Princess Ubolratana and Silarawee schools participated in a tree ordination ceremony and tree planting projects. The community also research forest routes, track plant seedlings, and learn about forest fire-extinguishing stations, which provide support to village security patrol operations.

In 2022, there are two other ongoing seedling heritage projects to increase green space:

### Community Forest Project, Northern Area, Chiang Mai Province

- Ban Chom Khiri in Mae Na Sub-district, Ban Thung Luk in Chiang Dao Sub-district, Ban Na Wai in Mueang Na Sub-district, and Ban Huai Pao in Khao Phuang Sub-district, covering a total of 46 rai in Chiang Dao District.

### Community Forest Project, West Area, Uthai Thani Province

- Ban Rong Madook and Ban Sap Fa Ruean in Hu Chang Sub-district, Ban Rai District, and Ban Tha Manao in Rabum Sub-district, Lan Sak District, covering a total of 30 rai.

# Speyburn Fish Ladder

The Speyburn-Glenlivet Distillery Company Limited, a ThaiBev subsidiary in Scotland, collaborated with Scottish charity, the Spey Foundation, on their second environmental project to increase fish populations along the River Spey. A new fish pass has been successfully constructed in the Granty Burn to overcome in-river obstacles that prevent salmon and sea trout from spawning and to improve the river’s biodiversity. This project follows the installation of the Mackalea Burn fish pass, also funded by Speyburn. The pass in the Granty Burn was created by extending an intake pipe for the distillery’s cooling pond upstream and building a temporary dam to divert water flow. Its design will open up high-quality breeding grounds to encourage spawning under all flow conditions.

# SeaTrees

ThaiBev’s subsidiaries in Scotland announced a collaboration with kelp restoration non-profit, SeaTrees, making a commitment to plant more than 4,000 mangrove trees globally, and restore 2,665 square-feet of kelp forest. This project is set to sequester carbon, increase biodiversity and protect over 700 species of fish, invertebrates and algae.

To celebrate this new partnership, a special US edition of Old Pulteney 12 Year Old Single Malt was released, with US$2 from the sale of every special-edition bottle being donated to SeaTrees.

# Achievements

ThaiBev has fully defined its exposure to critical biodiversity issues through a systematic assessment of all sites. The company has 24 locations (26 production sites) exposed to critical biodiversity issues, with a total area of 11.06 km2 (1,105.58 hectares). By FY2023, all ThaiBev’s production sites in Thailand exposed to critical biodiversity issues will have a management plan in place.

All ThaiBev’s production sites have official licenses to operate, in line with mandatory local legislation in Thailand as well as overseas (i.e. Ror Ngor 4 in Thailand and the equivalents at overseas production sites). ThaiBev ensures group-wide compliance with the no-deforestation commitment through monitoring systems as part of the company’s environmental policy. Supplier compliance is monitored through engagement and auditing at regular intervals. ThaiBev annually updates its progress towards eliminating gross deforestation from the supply chain by 2030, by engaging with suppliers in order to understand potential risks and resolve them accordingly.



# Caring for People

ThaiBev is deeply committed to the well-being of its employees, partners, consumers, and other stakeholders. The company’s culture of professionalism and excellence can be seen in its employee development programs, its advocacy and respect for diversity, its utmost attention to consumer health and safety, and its efforts to drive high customer satisfaction and engagement and co-development.

# Human Rights

ThaiBev believes that corporations have an important role in human rights. ThaiBev strictly protects human rights, within our organization as well as those of its stakeholders, and complies with national and international laws, regulations, and guiding principles such as the Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

ThaiBev aims to be a best-practice leader in this regard by preventing and reducing human rights risks affecting stakeholders and working environments to ensure strict compliance with the company’s Human Rights Policy.

ThaiBev attaches especial importance to human rights when they are related to climate resilience, believing that constructive engagement with stakeholders can lead to partnerships for building a more climate-resilient society.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev has identified key approaches for human rights management throughout the value chain. These include:

- Being committed to prevent violations and respect human rights in the areas of human trafficking, forced labour, child labour, freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, equal remuneration, discrimination and harassment, working conditions, and workplace safety and health.
- Respecting all human rights by treating all business units equally.
- Proactively managing human rights issues through a dedicated human rights due diligence process.
- Being responsible and committed to encouraging all parts of the organization to respect the human rights of all sectors, especially ThaiBev’s stakeholders, as well as to overseeing avoidance of human rights violations in all business activities.
- Having an effective mechanism to remedy, correct, rehabilitate and compensate for the impact of any human rights violation arising from the organization’s business activities.
- Clearly communicating the company’s human rights practices to all stakeholders and providing transparent and effective channels to file complaints.
- Providing knowledge, training, and support for employees, suppliers, and customers to ensure they strictly respect the human rights of all stakeholders involved in the company’s work.

# Human Rights Due Diligence Process

This program was initiated in 2017. In 2022, ThaiBev identified and assessed human rights risks related to stakeholders. There are salient issues human rights identified as follows:

- Employee health and safety
- Employee working conditions

5. Remediate adverse impacts

# 1. Policy Commitment

ThaiBev is committed to respecting the human rights of all stakeholders. The company operates in line with international human rights principles and labor standards, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. ThaiBev expects all executives and employees in its businesses, including those in its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and new business relations (i.e., through mergers and acquisitions), as well as suppliers and business partners, to respect the human rights of all stakeholders to ensure that all are respected equally. In doing so, strict compliance with the company’s Human Rights Policy is compulsory for all stakeholders.

Key human rights aspects covered in the company’s Human Rights Policy and Statement include human trafficking, discrimination and harassment, forced labor and child labor, freedom of association, rights to collective bargaining, equal remuneration, working conditions, and workplace safety and health. All ThaiBev stakeholders (including tier 1 suppliers and non-tier 1 suppliers) must comply with these aspects according to laws and regulations and aim to satisfy them to the highest possible standards.

To ensure supplier compliance, the human rights aspects mentioned above are covered in ThaiBev’s Supplier Code of Practice, which has been developed in accordance with relevant national laws and regulations. All suppliers have to sign and agree to the Supplier Code of Practice. Refusing or failing to follow the code will result in rejection/elimination as a vendor/supplier to ThaiBev.

In order to foster human rights practice, ThaiBev has established the welfare committee as a means to support the rights of freedom of association, and to receive employee grievances. The company also organizes training sessions to communicate committee roles for labor rights and welfare.

# 2. Assess Actual and Potential Impacts (Human Rights Risk Assessment)

The human rights risk assessment covered 100% of ThaiBev’s operational sites which were categorized by business activities:

- Main business activities: Sourcing, Production, Distribution and Logistics, Marketing and Sales, and Post-consumption Packaging Management
- Supporting business activities such as Human Resources

ThaiBev has identified human rights issues covering its own operations and those of tier 1 suppliers. If there is a case of merger and acquisition in the future, the assessment will also be conducted to identify any potential human rights issues.

# Human Rights Risk Assessment

The human rights risk assessment covers actual and potential human rights issues as follows:

- Forced labor
- Human trafficking
- Child labor
- Freedom of association
- Rights to collective bargaining
- Equal remuneration
- Discrimination and harassment
- Working conditions and OHS
- Related issues

The human rights risk assessment also covers at-risk/vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups include:

- Women
- Children
- Indigenous people
- Migrant workers
- Third-party employees
- Local communities
- LGBTQI+
- Disabled people

## Human Rights Risk Assessment Methodology

1. **Human Rights Issue Identification**
   - Identify all human rights issues relevant to ThaiBev’s own operations, value chain, and new business relations by considering the impacts on the business and potential rights holders.
   - Identify affected groups of stakeholders, including vulnerable people i.e. women, children, indigenous people, migrant labor, third-party contracted labor, local communities, LGBTQI+ and disabled people.

2. **Inherent Risk Ranking**
   - Rank inherent risks (risks without controls/measures) of identified human rights issues.

3. **Residual Risk Ranking**
   - Rank high inherent risk. Ranking the residual risks (risks with existing company controls/measures).

4. **Risk Prioritization**
   - Prioritize salient human rights issues, referring to identified human rights issues with high residual risk.

# 4. Track and Communicate Performance

ThaiBev is committed to conducting regular reviews of human rights due diligence, as well as to reporting its human rights performances on an annual basis through the sustainability report or ThaiBev website. The company tracks violations of human rights that stakeholders may experience through its communication channel. Therefore, in order to mitigate adverse impacts and to provide appropriate remedies all stakeholders are encouraged to report any violation through the communication channel given.

### Communication Channel

**Thai Beverage Public Company Limited**  
14 Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Chomphon.  
Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900  
Telephone: 02 785 5555 Fax: 02 785 5582  
[http://www.thaibev.com](http://www.thaibev.com)

ThaiBev has put in place plans for any necessary mitigation and remedial actions to tackle the issues raised through the designated channel.

# 5. Remediate Adverse Impacts

ThaiBev realizes that its business activities may potentially cause/contribute to or have linkage with human rights violations of relevant stakeholders. ThaiBev is thus committed to mitigate such potential risks and violations. To ensure fulfillment of these commitments, human rights risk assessments are conducted to identify situations of human rights violations at ThaiBev’s operations sites. Additional mitigation measures will be established to remediate and reduce the possibility of human rights violations, which may be caused or contributed to by ThaiBev’s business activities. In addition, monitoring, reporting of performance and reviewing of policy commitments regarding human rights will be annually conducted in order to maximize the effectiveness of ThaiBev’s human rights management.

In 2022, there was one reported human rights violation involving harassment. The offender was immediately terminated. ThaiBev took the victim for psychiatric treatment, visited the family, and provided supervision and counseling to the employee and the family about prosecuting the offender. In addition, there was also a job change to prevent the employee from having to return to the same environment, which may have had a negative psychological impact.

As the nature of ThaiBev’s operation is not involved with indigenous people, the number of incidents related to indigenous people was zero during the reporting period.

None of ThaiBev’s operations or suppliers impose a risk to the right to freedom of association, nor to child labor and forced labor rights.



### Freedom of Association

![Freedom of Association](image-placeholder)

ThaiBev employees are covered by Welfare Committees in which committee members are elected from the employee body to represent themselves in negotiations with the company. Welfare Committees are set up at all major operations across the country and cover all of ThaiBev business units. The committees have a role to provide advice and welfare management, resulting in strengthened relationships and understanding between the company and its employees. This platform provides motivation and encouragement in their work. It serves as a guideline for continuous improvement of welfare, enabling the company and employees to discuss matters openly and sincerely.

## Employee Wellness Team

ThaiBev formed the Employee Wellness Team in the Human Capital Group with the goal of making ThaiBev a happy workplace. This working group oversees the company’s worksites to ensure they are suitable for employees and meet relevant laws, and also to monitor employee-related human rights risks. The company promotes employee well-being through activities such as seminars on stress management. Since 2020, the working group, Human Capital unit, and relevant business units have helped employees prevent the spread of COVID-19 by comprehensively coordinating wellness efforts, distributing masks and alcohol gel, and facilitating other assistance measures for employees.

# Employee Wellbeing

A company’s best asset is its employees, who help promote the company’s reputation and are responsible for its success. For this reason, ThaiBev cares deeply about its employees’ safety and well-being, and constantly strives to promote the safety of all stakeholders as a basic right. ThaiBev has produced guidelines and safety management systems to ensure that the company remains in line with legal and international standards on safety, occupational health, and working environments for its employees, business partners, and other stakeholders. This includes risk prevention measures for accidents, injuries, and illnesses linked to operations, along with support to create working environments that promote employees’ physical and emotional well-being as well as their quality of work life.

In 2022, ThaiBev continued to respond to COVID-19, as part of its plans to deal with unexpected scenarios. ThaiBev has always worked to better equip itself to deal with such challenges and to support its employees and their families.

# Management Approach

To meet legal and internal standards, ThaiBev has set guidelines in four areas:

1. Safety
2. Occupational Health
3. Working Environment
4. Employee Wellbeing

ThaiBev has set up a process to identify work-related hazards, which is reviewed by the health and safety team once a year. The team also carries out risk assessments when needed, for example when there is a near-miss incident. In addition, they host weekly, monthly, and annual meetings to discuss and make decisions about employees’ health, safety, and well-being.

The company has set up a communication channel for employees and stakeholders to report incidents or raise any concerns regarding health and safety. All employees also receive annual health and safety training, which equips them to detect situations that may pose a threat in both the working and non-working environments. ThaiBev’s health and safety policy is implemented and enforced by the Employee Wellness Team.

With the objectives of controlling, managing, and eliminating hazards and reducing risks for both regular and non-routine jobs, hazard identification and risk assessment are conducted once a year for all activities, areas, and services. Risks are assessed as to their severity and the likelihood of their occurrence, according to the procedures of Job Safety Analysis (JSA), which is required by ISO 45001:2018.

After any incident where a significant level of risk is detected, it will be used to create a risk mitigation plan, including the preparation of a Safety Standard Operation Procedure (SSOP), in accordance with requirements covering all stakeholders throughout the supply chain.

ThaiBev ensures that our operators work according to the occupational health and safety management system standard ISO 45001 and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2011.

## Safety

ThaiBev is committed to implementing high-quality safety management systems and so far 27 facilities have been certified to ISO 45001 standards. The corporate safety team continues to conduct periodic on-site safety inspections at all facilities. This includes ThaiBev’s facilities in Thailand and overseas.

ThaiBev has established safety clinics with volunteer teams to create a safety culture. There are various channels for OHS communication through the complaints system, including documents, phone calls, and e-mails, to make communication accessible to all employees. A communication channel has been established on the Line application whereby employees can receive information conveniently and quickly, and can interact through this two-way platform. The effectiveness of communications is measured by the event team, who proactively conduct questionnaires online with the target group of each activity, to gauge their levels of understanding before and after. All employees cooperate very well in completing these questionnaires.

In addition, there is a monthly safety meeting in each area, attended by representatives from management and employees. These meetings determine what safety activities should be conducted, including handling complaints or suggestions from employees. The meeting committee conducts the discussion and determines any corrective measure, as well as following up on any amendments.

# Employee Wellbeing

ThaiBev has organized a series of integrated actions to prepare responses to emergency situations:

- Firefighting training and fire evacuation drills
- Working in confined spaces training
- Forklift driving skills training
- Contingency plans in radiation operations
- Training in case of flammable liquid spills
- Emergency plans for flood prevention
- Emergency moving plans and storage of industrial waste
- Emergency plans for boiler explosions
- Emergency plans in case of a chlorine gas leak
- Emergency plans in case of an ammonia gas leak
- Emergency plans in the event of an oil spill

ThaiBev conducts mandatory training on subjects such as fire safety and road safety for employees and other relevant parties, daily safety briefings at the beginning of each working day at production plants, ISO 45001 occupational health and safety standards training, and training for safety officers in all business units.

## Occupational Health

- **Care**  
  ThaiBev ensures employee health by providing on-site doctors and nurses for medical treatments and health consultations. The company also has agreements with nearby hospitals to treat injured or sick employees so they can quickly and conveniently receive medical treatment at any time.

- **Prevention**  
  ThaiBev helps employees prevent illness, for instance by providing annual vaccinations.

- **Treatment**  
  ThaiBev provides support for outpatient medical expenses for employees, in addition to social security contributions that the company pays under the law. The company also provides accident insurance and inpatient illness insurance for all employees.

- **Check-ups**  
  ThaiBev arranges annual health checks for all employees according to gender, age, and other risk factors. These include prostate and breast cancer screening for employees in certain age groups, and an additional check-up for factory employees who have other work-related risk factors.

- **Education**  
  ThaiBev provides educational materials and training on healthcare and common diseases for employees and their family members, including office syndrome and stress reduction. In addition, the company provides basic life-saving skills training for employees, and a first-aid CPR AED training course.

# Work-from-home Arrangements

ThaiBev values a flexible workplace, including working from home arrangements. It believes this option increases productivity, morale, agility, and cross-business collaboration. The company has implemented work-from-home guidelines for when adverse situations could harm employees' health and safety. These include environmental issues such as PM2.5 pollution, political unrest, and pandemics (ThaiBev announced strict protocols for working from home during COVID-19 to ensure that all employees were safe). The company supports employees working from home, helping them achieve high performance by offering training and required equipment. Wellness programs have been adjusted to promote exercise, ergonomics, and stress management. ThaiBev has also arranged effective work-from-home support for disabled employees who face difficulties traveling to work.

# Working Environment

Flexible working hours are also allowed for in-the-field employees such as sales reps, whose performance is results-oriented, to facilitate effective time management. For remaining staff, flexible working hours are supported through the time management system as long as they receive an endorsement from their supervisors. In addition, convenient virtual working stations have been set up in multiple locations, allowing employees to carry out their work without having to be present in the office.

# Part-time working options

We recognize the value of the knowledge and experience of our senior or retired employees who have long years of service with the organization. Part-time working options for them in place.

# Family Policies

- Achieving a work-family balance is part of ThaiBev’s well-being goals to promote employee productivity and morale. The company demonstrates this commitment by providing space or playgrounds at factories for children while they are accompanying or waiting for their parents. In addition, private breastfeeding rooms are available at all offices and production plants. ThaiBev has expanded its childcare facilities to include classes and recreational activities during school vacations. A popular family program at the company is Children’s Day, which brings together children and their parents for special activities, field trips, and CSR activities to promote spending time together.

- ThaiBev is strongly committed to its female employees, who can take up to 100 days of paid maternity leave. This is 10 days more than the legal requirement in Thailand. In some cases, new mothers may ask for an additional 30 days. The company believes these measures promote family values and foster health and well-being for both mother and child.

- Furthermore, recognizing family as a central foundation of life, ThaiBev allows male employees to take paid paternity leave of up to six days, which is not part of the national legal requirement.

# Employee Wellbeing

## Beverest Life

In 2020, ThaiBev implemented a no-contact procedure for all employees to check in to their work through an internal mobile application, Beverest Life. This application will be used going forward as part of standard safety measures to increase efficiency, decrease contact, and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

- **Promote safety culture and extend activities** related to occupational health and safe working environments to **ThaiBev’s subsidiaries in ASEAN**.

- **ThaiBev is committed to a zero-fatality target.**

- **Employee LTIFR is 1.36**

- **Non-employee LTIFR is 1.05**

- **This trend is in line with our goal of achieving a LTIFR of lower than 1.0 by 2025.**

ThaiBev ensures road-safety discipline among employees by organizing training and other activities to promote safety. The project will be extended to employees in other regions and our business partners to reduce driving mortality rates, which mostly involve accidents caused by violations of traffic laws and lack of road-safety discipline.

Build a network of safety officers in ThaiBev Group throughout ASEAN, to increase the effectiveness of safety activities and allow more extensive communication and exchange of information. Provide advanced safety training to these officers on a regular basis.

Work with employees to proactively administer new health guidelines. Raise awareness, encourage employees to exercise and maintain good hygiene, reduce work-related stress, and provide vaccinations against diseases that occur frequently among employees, to promote a healthier life and a happier workplace.

# Key Projects

## ThaiBev Internship Program for ASEAN Students

In 2022, ThaiBev has continued to build a candidate pipeline for ASEAN students through this in-house internship program. This not only helps ThaiBev to strengthen its position regionally, but also provides great experience and learning opportunities for young people across the region.

This year saw a total of 37 interns from various countries joining the program. Many exclusive activities were organized during the two-month journey such as networking sessions with ThaiBev top executives and ASEAN young professionals, as well as career advice sessions. The core of the program is on-the-job-training with each business unit in various job functions, such as local and international marketing for food and beverages, business development, human capital, finance, and supply chain management, as well as the youth networking program (including the leadership program, CSR, and ASEAN arts and culture projects).

The program continued to receive great feedback from the participants, with a total overall score of 4.30 (out of 5) in the program satisfaction survey. Once again this year, 100 percent of the interns stated their desire to join ThaiBev after graduation.

## KFC People Development Program

To sustainably develop our people’s capabilities, ThaiBev focuses on designing functional programs based on the contexts of each product group and business unit.

The program aims to improve their people development knowledge and training skills. It serves not only our business strategy but also our HR philosophy of “Limitless Opportunities” in career development.

Overall, the program results are very satisfying, with 63.80% of the participants (67 people) having been promoted to KFC restaurant managers. In addition, 100% of the participants (105 people) successfully demonstrated knowledge and skills application through project assignments.

# Consumer Health and Safety

Consumer health and safety is the top priority for ThaiBev. We recognize the importance of producing high-quality, safe and healthy food and beverages from ethically sourced, high-quality ingredients. We adhere to strict quality standards and closely monitor all our operations to ensure consistent quality and safety throughout production, storage, transportation, and last mile service. These efforts have also led us to adopt international standards, such as ISO 22000, NSF, GMP, and HACCP. ThaiBev also ensures that consumers have the option to choose healthier, more nutritional products, as a way of improving public health and well-being.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev is committed to promoting a wide range of healthy drinks, disclosing nutritional information on products, recommending daily servings, as well as conducting marketing activities that focus on enhancing health.

Beyond strict quality control in our production process, ThaiBev also has a research and development team dedicated to new product development. The company collaborates with external agencies, such as universities and business partners, to conduct research and development on healthier products for consumers. Examples of these developments include:

1. Low sugar content
2. Controlling and reducing sodium content
3. Fortifying products
4. Elimination of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and preservatives in packaged products

Additionally, ThaiBev continues to collaborate with suppliers in sourcing high-quality raw materials and ingredients.

## Health and Nutrition Advisory Panel

The purpose of this advisory panel is to deliver healthy, nutritious products to consumers and to develop the capabilities of the product R&D center. The panel is led by ThaiBev’s Chief of Food Business (Thailand), who has more than 25 years’ experience in the food and beverage industry. As part of ThaiBev’s transformation programs to build new capabilities, the panel gives advice to all product groups on health and wellness innovation, with responsibility for:

- Supporting education, information, technology updates, and market trends for all Product Groups
- Initiating strategies in health and wellness innovation
- Promoting research and development for all Product Groups to support product innovation and consumer health and wellness

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

## 2022 Highlight

### ZEA Tuna Essence

Together with Thai Union Group, ThaiBev has developed and launched an innovative healthy drink, ZEA Tuna Essence. Tuna is rich in protein and many other nutrients that are needed for a healthy body, especially vitamin B12, zinc, selenium, and Omega 3 fatty acids. These substantial benefits are extracted by using nanofiltration technology, which minimizes protein molecules for easy absorption. Our production is tested for quality and nutritional value by Japan Food Research Laboratories, a leading food research institute in Japan, to guarantee that every bottle is of the highest quality. The use of premium deep-sea tuna combined with innovative production technology ensures maximum value for consumers. ZEA Tuna Essence is available in two flavors: rich and savory original flavor and easy-to-drink and delicious passion fruit flavor.

# Key Projects

## Mixed Grain Sandwich

OISHI Eato continues to create healthy products such as sandwiches with bread made from wheat, barley, and soy. Choices include an avocado, shrimp and egg sandwich, grilled tuna with fish sauce sandwich, and chicken, ham and quinoa salad green tea sandwich. Healthy ingredients such as organic quinoa and unbleached wheat flour are used. Our new products, like the mixed-grain sandwiches stuffed with smoked chicken breast or egg salad with whey protein, benefit from a variety of specially selected grains of wheat and barley.

## Honey Lemon Green Tea 0% Sugar

OISHI Honey Lemon Green Tea is a very popular drink that customers have long been familiar with. Accordingly, it was an ideal product for developing a healthier alternative: OISHI Honey Lemon Green Tea 0% Sugar. Delicious, fresher and healthier, the tea can be drunk often without worrying about sugar. It has the unique aroma of Hyakkamitsu honey from Japan, a good combination with the sourness of lemon. The drink is produced from young, high-quality tea leaves, rich in the benefits of catechin, which helps to neutralize free radicals, strengthen immunity and slow down the deterioration of the body.

## Plant-Based Protein

ThaiBev has been developing healthy menus based on an innovative plant-based protein, Omni Meat, which is made from shiitake mushrooms, peas, non-genetically modified soybeans, and rice. Rich in protein and fiber but low in fat, cholesterol and saturated fat. It was initially sold during Thailand’s Vegetarian Festival. The products that have been developed so far include fried ramen with sweet basil sauce sold at OISHI Ramen, and basil rice sold at Kakashi outlets.

# Customer Relationship Management

ThaiBev continuously seeks new opportunities to build better relationships with our customers, especially sales agents, who are key to the business’s success. The company has initiated numerous projects including digital platforms to develop their operational capabilities. We also work closely with our customers as business consultants to jointly grow sales and profit, and to increase their confidence and satisfaction in working with ThaiBev.

Recognizing the importance of our customers, ThaiBev conducts an opinion survey annually via a third party. We also ensure that all our customers are treated fairly.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev seeks to build strong relationships with customers to promote their highest satisfaction through the following strategies:

- Supporting agents’ businesses to grow sustainably
- Developing agents’ professional capabilities
- Collaborating with agents and business partners to increase product knowledge and skills in digital promotion and services
- Improving existing applications and exploring new digital platforms to engage customers and consumers to build more brand loyalty
- Increasing awareness of health and safety through campaigns and training

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

- Maintain customer satisfaction scores at **90%** or higher in all commercial aspects
- Continue to help agents grow with sustainability
- Build greater sales and marketing engagement with consumers and deeper partnerships with customers
- Continue to expand our Serve Responsibly training, and to share knowledge about social responsibility with our customers, including those in promotions, sales, and marketing
- Increase the share of online sales in the food business both through ThaiBev’s own platforms and on partner platforms

## 2022 Highlight

### Serve Responsibly

The Serve Responsibly program consists of workshops to raise awareness about safe consumption among alcohol service providers, including hotels and restaurants that are ThaiBev’s partners. In place since 2016, the project has held a total of 11 training sessions for over 550 service providers.

In 2022, two training sessions were organized, one in Hua Hin and one in Krabi province. Medical professionals, police, and lawyers shared knowledge and practical guidelines for providing responsible service, taking into account the safety of consumers. Participants created mocktail recipes under the concept, “What will you serve to a customer who is drunk?”

The satisfaction rating given to the training this year increased to 96%. In 2022, there were a total of 100 participants, each of whom serves alcoholic drinks to an average of 6,000 customers per year. It means that over the course of a year, around 600,000 customers will have been well taken care of by these trained staff.

For 2023, ThaiBev plans to hold training sessions in Buriram and Chiang Rai, two provinces with many hotels and restaurants in the company’s partner network.

This project is in line with UN SDG Target 3.5, to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.

## Customer Engagement

The COVID-19 pandemic and lifestyle changes have led not only consumers to engage more with brands via digital media, but also customers to use digital platforms more frequently for communication and trade programs. Under the strategic imperatives of ThaiBev’s vision, we have strengthened our digital platforms to integrate sales and marketing strategies for brand engagement at every possible touch point. Examples include the Sermsuk Family and Chang Family Line official accounts for business partners’ engagement.

## Sermsuk Family

Sermsuk Family is a Line Official Account to connect with business partners (retailers and wholesalers), in order to build engagement and brand loyalty. It is used to communicate product and merchandising knowledge and to advertise new products and monthly promotions. The highlight of this app is the points collection program which allows members to collect and redeem various premium prizes and discounts. The number of customers who follow this account has increased by 25% from 51,577 in its first year, 2020, to 64,370 in 2022.

In addition, Sermsuk Family has introduced promotional activities to boost product purchases through monthly discount coupons. Participation in this coupon redemption activity is as high as 40%.

# Caring for Society

The company continues to launch new initiatives to support the most vulnerable and needy, while also promoting broader societal development through economic growth and empowering people to reach their full potential.

# Caring and Sharing, Creating Values for Society

ThaiBev believes that its mission of “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth” is a key foundation for sustainable development. Living by its motto, “Always with You”, the company remains dedicated to corporate social responsibility programs focusing on five key dimensions: Education, Public Health, Sports, Arts and Culture, and Community and Social Development.

ThaiBev has cooperated with leading business partners in sustainability development to create many collaborative platforms, projects and activities, all of which have had substantial impacts on society both in Thailand and overseas.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev has adopted the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as a guideline in business management, following the first royal command by His Majesty King Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun to “Continue, Sustain and Develop the Legacy”, inherited from the initiatives of His Late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. This has driven the organization towards sustainability, in tandem with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). The company has also incorporated an ESG framework—environmental responsibility, a network of business alliances in all sectors throughout the value chain (social), along with good governance principles and the company’s code of conduct—as an important strategy to drive operations and help society. This approach has enabled us to build on successful results by establishing good relationships with all stakeholders, with the goal of becoming a stable and sustainable leader in ASEAN’s food and beverage sector.

ThaiBev plans its Corporate Social Responsibility projects, which are guided by top executives and led by the CEO, in three phases: short, middle, and long terms. Directors and employees are encouraged to participate in volunteer activities and all forms of public charity. Many working groups within the company are also dedicated to community development projects. These efforts are divided into two parts:

1. **At the corporate level**, they comprise a department dedicated to community development programs:
   - A group that aims to enhance quality of life and help the environment.
   - An external affairs group.
   - A Thai talent project group.
   - A group supporting arts and culture, and C asean.
   - A group from human resources.
   - A group from corporate communications.

   In mid-2019, the structure of corporate-level CSR working groups was reorganized to be more integrated. This led to internal operations and cross operations between groups becoming more effective. Weekly meetings are held between project owners in the five key dimensions to discuss opinions, to seek connections between projects and to allocate budgets optimally. After this structural change, ThaiBev has been able to create better value and reduce overlaps by half.

2. **At the local level**, there are public relations and environmental groups in each factory, which work in tandem with those at the corporate level. Each agency coordinates and runs the projects it has initiated, in cooperation with various groups in society.

   ThaiBev has procedures for initiating projects and activities to benefit communities, society, and the environment with operational guidelines for each project to focus on concrete actions, continuity, and scalability. The Company has also created partnerships with its networks and all stakeholders. ThaiBev has regularly assessed the social and environmental impacts through building relationships with and seeking opinions and needs from target communities around our factories, facilities, and those close to ThaiBev products. The company has periodically conducted survey research by using questionnaires or interviews, organizes public meeting discussion with community leaders, parents, school board in order to gain insight for further improvement. The sponsored or initiated project must have a concrete performance measurement of its social and environmental impacts, community and stakeholders’ satisfaction survey including progress monitoring through reports by relevant agencies such as government agencies, universities, civil society. Such strategies and management processes help ThaiBev drive sustainable development while strengthening its business groups including protecting the environment, supporting local communities, and elevating business operations according to good governance principles. Moreover, ThaiBev has created collaborative platforms to drive sustainable development through various projects such as Win Win WAR Thailand, C asean and Education Institute Support Activity (eisa) projects, etc.

# Caring and Sharing, Creating Values for Society

One of the highlight achievements has been the establishment of the Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise, which operates in 77 provinces across Thailand with the aims of generating income for communities and making people happy. Activities are carried out in three categories: Agriculture, Added-value Products, and Community-based Tourism. Since its founding, more than 1,433 projects have been initiated, covering 4,512 communities (107,000 households) and generating more than 1.8 billion Baht in income.

Moreover, ThaiBev was the originator of a number of other highly successful projects, including the Power of Thai Foundation, Foundation for the Institute of Social Enterprise Development Thailand (FINSEDT), and Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN).

As a Dow Jones Sustainability Index World Leader, ThaiBev initiated the Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) for the first time in 2020 under the concept of "Sufficiency for Sustainability". To reinforce Thailand's first great collaboration platform for sustainable development, the Expo was held for a third consecutive year in 2022. This year, there were over 280,000 visitors to SX 2022, 126 restaurants and organic markets, and a network of sustainable businesses, including community shops from 50 provinces, generating total sales of more than 28 million Baht. In addition, ThaiBev has innovated further cooperation platforms such as Win Win WAR Thailand, C asean and the Education Institute Support Activity (eisa) projects.

The company remains committed to creating positive environmental and social impacts, as well as minimizing any negative impacts that can potentially arise from its operations, by emphasizing water stewardship, GHG emission reduction, packaging circularity, and waste management.



## In 2022, ThaiBev allocated a budget of 500 million Baht to 5 key areas, as follows:

| Area                  | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|

# Education Development

ThaiBev focuses on educational projects that develop potential in a variety of ways, promoting young people’s knowledge in areas such as sustainable development, financial discipline, preserving culture, traditions, the environment, and natural resources, as well as nurturing business and entrepreneurial skills. Through learning both inside and outside the classroom, young people can build their experience, life skills, adaptability, and creativity, which are the cornerstones of life in the ever-changing 21st century. ThaiBev believes that this will help lay a strong foundation of well-being, quality of life and good citizenship to develop a sustainable future for the country.

# Key Projects

## Connext ED Program

For the fourth consecutive year, ThaiBev has supported Connext ED in over 200 primary and secondary schools nationwide, in collaboration with partner universities in 27 locations. The program aims to:

- Increase knowledge and create opportunities for students to develop business skills

## Partnership School Project

This project gives the private sector the opportunity to work with school administrators in planning school development. Focusing on developing vocational, life, and moral skills, ThaiBev executives have worked with 24 schools in 18 provinces, benefiting 15,000 students.

# Insights

**Somnuek Manapim**  
Teacher, Ban Nong Lai (Putta Permwattanarat) School, Ubon Ratchathani Province

In 2017, I joined with the intention of using the skills and knowledge to create products for students to earn some income. This inspired students to find out what is outstanding and interesting in our community and can be further developed into products. In this way, Gac Pulp Tea products were improved to generate income for the school and students.

# Education Development

## Bakery Activity Project, Mae Waluang School, Tak Province

This ongoing and sustainable project involves ten students in Grade 9. Their baking activity generates continuous income as working capital for the school. Last year, the project made a total income of 19,706 Baht.

## Education Institute Support Activity (eisa)

ThaiBev’s eisa project supports higher education with the following objectives:
1. Supporting sports in higher education
2. Promoting practical curricula
3. Supporting student activities such as rural development volunteer camps and academic fairs

Currently, more than 50 universities in all regions of the country take part in the project. Students participate in training, gain experience, work with the community, and acquire more skills and expertise.

The increase in the number of partnerships has helped to drive many economic development projects, such as the Creative Young Designers initiative in the Local Pakaoma Handicraft Project (see the “Pracharath Rak Samakee” chapter); Prachuap More, a sustainable development project for community enterprises in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province; and the Mo Hom Fabric Product Development Project in Phrae Province. These three eisa projects also enhance vocational skills by transferring knowledge from the university to the community. The project has created learning spaces for 1,355 students.

The Education Institute Support Activity project sets out clear guidelines for implementing both the creation of a learning area to achieve real practice for students on a continuous basis as well as the support of sport competitions in higher education. The project aims to create quality talents that are needed by many organizations and the society.

## Insights

It is valuable knowledge and experience that cannot be found anywhere else. These learnings are valuable treasures that students can use in the future. Thanks to the eisa project for being an important support, and giving students the opportunity to learn, it also helps to promote a foundation for community businesses and affairs in Thailand, and to create good things for a sustainable Thai society.

# Beta Young Entrepreneur Project

This collaboration between the Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation nurtures young people into entrepreneurs who are knowledgeable, virtuous, and socially responsible. Throughout the course, activities help cultivate morals and develop potential through real business experiments.

There have been eleven generations of Beta Young Entrepreneurs, comprising over 200 students, of whom eight generations have already graduated from the project. More than 75% of project graduates have applied the knowledge and experience gained to their own business or in continuing their family business. For example, Mr. Sapthawee Koilalrat, Beta Young Entrepreneur Generation 6, has used online knowledge to teach farmers in Roi Et Province how to manage rice trading in a more modern and systematic way. In his family's construction company, Mr. Padungdej Sararat, from the same year group, has created jobs for people in the community to earn income, so that they do not have to seek employment outside their home area.

## Insights

The Beta Young Entrepreneur project gave me the opportunity to actually do it.

I came back to develop the Phrae Nakara Hotel and look for opportunities to expand the business.

In addition, ThaiBev has made a success of its sports sponsorships, creating a good image for the organization and its product brands. Our criteria for creating projects are threefold: the project is in an area with strong sports alliances; the project is in one of ThaiBev’s business areas; and the project is requested by the community. This enables ThaiBev to respond to the needs of the community comprehensively and efficiently.

In 2022, ThaiBev has continued its cooperation with sports associations such as the Football Association of Thailand and the Volleyball Association of Thailand, as well as with more than 30 sports clubs. In this way, we can help to give direction to the Thai sports industry and create clear goals for the organization’s personnel in the operation of sports, in alignment with sustainable development.

## Football

ThaiBev has been playing a role in Thai football for over 20 years with the goal to develop Thai football both upstream and downstream, by creating cooperation with the Football Association of Thailand, football clubs, organizations and communities in each project to international standards. The aim is to develop personnel to enter the football industry continuously and sustainably. At the youth level, ThaiBev has implemented five main projects that can be measured for further improvement and development to higher levels. In addition to creating sustainable personnel for the sports industry, it is important to use sports as a tool to promote good health, create a good quality of life, and good opportunities for young people throughout Thailand, so that they can learn sports skills properly from professional trainers with the use of modern equipment.

## Sinthaweechai Hathairattanakool

He is Thailand's legendary goalkeeper, who has been on the national team for 14 years. From a rising star to a professional player, he is still in the Thai League at the age of 40. He is a role model for the younger generation, both at the club and national team level with discipline, dedication, and good attitude. He is a fighter in the field, who is ready to fight until the last minute.

"I've been in love with football for a long time. I enjoy playing football every day. Football has given me everything - fame, money, gold, and a lot of life opportunities.

Football has allowed me to learn that in the game you can either lose or win and it is the same in life, which has its ups and downs. As long as there's still breath, we've got to keep fighting like we're playing football. If there is time, we have to fight until the last second ... We only have to be honest, selfless and disciplined."

Sportsmanship means more than losing and winning, but it's about mastering yourself. It's a feeling of being able to move beyond things and be happy with your opponent.

## Nitithorn Thippong

He is a golfer who had been participating on the Chang Thailand Golf Circuit since 2014 before being selected for the Thai Talent program, which supported training to develop his skills. He became a professional golfer on the Asian Tour at the age of 25.

"I dreamed of becoming a professional golfer, competing at the PGA level. To compete on the Asian Tour, it is like I've taken a step towards the PGA level, even though I haven't reached that level yet. What I want everyone to know is that I'm fully focused on training and doing everything I can at this point."

He has won two Asian Tour tournaments in India and Singapore in 2022.

# Preservation of National Arts and Culture

ThaiBev fully recognizes the importance of preserving Thailand’s artistic heritage and traditions. Accordingly, the company cooperates with Arts and Cultural projects with the aim of “bringing Thainess to the world.” Additionally, we believe that artistic and cultural activities can create sources of income for communities and can serve as effective tools to convey the sustainability concept.

# Management Approach

Arts and Culture are truly international, helping to build partnerships in business and society and create benefits and share values with the community.

ThaiBev’s strategies to connect networks and stakeholders are preservation, sustainability, creating value, and collaboration. These are integrated into the four Arts and Culture working groups, namely visual arts, music and literature, culture and traditions, and temple and religion. Under the scrutiny of policy guidelines and driven by the Arts and Culture Committee, this leads to participation, access, and mutual understanding. Coming from the private sector, ThaiBev is ready to support communities in building a strong foundation so that they are self-sufficient and happy, ready to create value and share it with society. In this way, the nation will continue to make sustainable progress.

All four sectors of Arts and Culture have implemented important projects in 2022 to promote sustainability and benefit society.

# Water Festival 2022

ThaiBev helped to organize the seventh annual Water Festival, on the theme of “Sai Nam Yam Fa Sai”. It was held during 11-15 April, 2022, over the period of Thai New Year (Songkran). In Bangkok, nine sections of the riverfront along the Chao Phraya River were decorated as tourist attractions. Events were also held in Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Udon Thani, Khon Kaen, and Phuket.

# Preservation of National Arts and Culture

## River Festival 2021

To coincide with Thailand’s annual Loy Krathong festival in November 2021, ThaiBev organized the seventh annual River Festival of Thai Culture, on the theme of “Wan Pen Yen Jai”, at eight historic boat landings in Bangkok: Wat Phra Chetuphon, Wat Arun, Wat Prayun, Wat Kalayanamit, Wat Rakhang, Tha Maharaj, SOOKSIAM at ICONSIAM, and Asiatique The Riverfront.

The Lamphun River Festival was organized for the third time, with the concept of “presenting lanterns to light up the city” to welcome the country’s reopening after the pandemic, as well as the opening of a community market. The lanterns are local handicraft products which generate community income.

## ESG Value of the Festivals: Clean-Klong

An adjunct to the festivals, this project aims to enhance the development of riverside communities and raise awareness about the conservation of water channels and the rehabilitation of rivers and canals (Klong). After the Loy Krathong festival each year, volunteers from various agencies, university students, and local residents participate in cleaning the waterways.

## ESG Value of the Festivals: Bring Back-Recycle

This project raises awareness of waste management in the community. Workshops are held with community leaders and young people to gain insights and brainstorm possible solutions. Then ThaiBev monitors and selects communities that are willing and able to operate “Bring Back-Recycle” recycling stations. The profits from selling the recyclable waste go towards improving community facilities.

### Results at Two “Bring Back-Recycle” Stations in the First Month after their Establishment

# Social Value of the Festivals: Young Cultural Hosts

Young people between the ages of 10 and 18 from the local communities are trained as Young Cultural Hosts, to tell community stories of pride and history to visitors. The project's arts and culture workshops help to engage them in lifelong learning outside the classroom. They are also groomed as "active citizens" who can drive their communities towards sustainability and ESG principles.

## Achievements of the Festivals

- **7 Years** of proven results
- Now reaching communities in **6 provinces in 4 regions**
  - 200,000 people on average (pre-COVID) visited the two festivals in Bangkok each year
- **100 Young Cultural Hosts** developed since 2014, with **39 scholarships** granted to those who satisfied the criteria

### Financial and Media Impact

- **2.5 million reach** of online influencers' pages to promote community food and crafts during lockdown
- **4.15 million Baht**: the highest revenue ever generated for communities from the two festivals (Bangkok 2018)
- **2.6 million Baht** in earned media value (domestic and international) from the two festivals each year
- **2.22 million Baht** generated for communities in 6 provinces from the Water Festival in April 2022

After promotion of a walking tour around the Kudeejeen neighborhood at the Bangkok Water Festival in April 2022, **community-based tourism visitors to the area increased sixfold** in May 2022 compared to March 2022.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

ThaiBev continues to promote arts, culture, and the "Pride of Thainess", according to its aspirations for stable and sustainable social development activities. Because the arts and culture are universal and interconnected, it's possible to build cooperation among all sectors of society, to achieve the effective implementation of ThaiBev’s socially responsible activities. The strategy is grounded in four principles: stable growth, sustainability, creating value, collaboration, and partnership.

These principles are followed by the working groups in four fields: Visual Arts, Music and Literary Arts, Culture and Traditions, and Religion.

# Community and Social Development

ThaiBev places great emphasis on building cooperative relationships with communities. Committed to the sustainable development of society, the company initiates multiple projects for community well-being, with the aim of creating self-reliant local economies. These development efforts reinforce ThaiBev’s mission of “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth.”

# 2022 Highlight

## ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold

ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold took place for the 23rd consecutive year, delivering 200,000 "green blankets" to people affected by the cold in the northern and northeastern regions. In this collaborative program with the Ministry of Interior’s Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation and partner agencies in the public and private sectors, 4,500,000 blankets have been given out so far in total. This is the third year of production of eco-friendly blankets, made of recycled PET (rPET) from plastic bottles. Over the past 3 years, we have brought over 22.8 million post-consumer PET bottles back into the recycling system and turned them into more than 600,000 green blankets.

The program also donates scholarships and instructional equipment to schools and organizes mobile medical units to provide healthcare to those receiving blankets. This year, the project held activities on sorting waste and planting trees, to create awareness among communities about environmental conservation issues. ThaiBev employees are also part of sharing the warmth through the campaign “One Share, One Warm”, bringing blankets to children in areas other than the 15 provinces of the ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold project.

ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold project aims to energize cooperation and expands the network to all sectors in order to jointly create a sustainable “giving” society.

## Insights

**Duangporn Yoje**  
*a villager who suffered from the cold*

I'm surprised that the blanket, which is made of water bottles, is so soft, so warm. I would like to thank ThaiBev for doing good things that are useful to society.

# Key Projects

## Chumchondee Meeroiyim Project for a New Generation

This project is an extension of the Hometown Empowerment Project for a new generation of community business developers, who are enabled to connect with business partners in various sectors to create sustainable benefits for their home towns. In 2022, the project generated income of 14,057,873 Baht with 1,298 beneficiaries.

### Target

"ThaiBev is committed to developing the community economy. Create sustainable happiness for oneself."

### Mission

- Build a prototype developed area
- Build a network for partners
- Upgrade social enterprises
- Create a new generation to develop together

## Operational Pilot Areas

### Chumchondee Meeroiyim Nong Khai (Social Business groups, Organic Farming Network Development Project)

This project drives jobs in Nong Khai town, with the cooperation of farmers who want to solve the problem of unstable markets. The farmers met to analyze the issue and decided that the community should turn to safe, organic vegetable production, in order to deliver clean food to Nong Khai Hospital and organic vegetables to marketing channels such as shopping malls.

The Safe Agriculture Promotion Group was set up to bring products to the market under a fair management system, and to reduce the use of agrochemicals. This group comprises 23 farmers' households, three of which have been selected as models for other members. In 2022, the project generated income of 5,921,199 Baht. There are 176 beneficiaries in 3 communities and the group's total vegetable planting area is 30 rai.

## Insights

**Tita Kothisen**  
Director of Public Relations, Safe Agriculture Promotion Group

We're grateful to the project for helping to reshape the community's mindset about growing vegetables. The community didn’t know where to go to sell at a good price. In addition to that, our vegetables have been certified safe and marketable. It can be sold to hospitals to provide patients with good food, and is now being expanded to sell in department stores. The group has a good operation, helping to create jobs for people in the community.

# Chumchondee Meerrojim Nakhon Si Thammarat (Social Business Groups, Project to Expand Marketing Channels for Agricultural Products and Processed Foods)

Starting during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was difficult to sell or export agricultural products, this project has created more jobs for people in three districts of Nakhon Si Thammarat province: Phrom Khiri, Pak Phanang, and Mueang. Members formed a group to develop management and transportation systems, accept customer orders via online channels, and coordinate a network of partners to find markets for selling the community products.

The project helps in dealing with the oversupply of fruits and works with educational agencies to enhance knowledge, for example about pomelos, mangosteens, papayas, and processed products to add value to durian and mangosteen. In addition, it also connects with marketing channels for online and offline sales. In 2022, it generated income of 6,890,270 Baht for 10 beneficiary communities, with 420 beneficiaries.

## Insights

**Amporn Sawatsuk**  
Chairman of Bang Duke House Grapefruit Group

We have a lot of pomegranate grapefruit this year. There are problems with transportation and goods could not be sold due to COVID. But the Chumchondee Meerrojim Project gave us help. This has increased sales a lot. If we didn’t have a good community with smiles, we wouldn’t be able to sell that much. Thanks to the project that really helps farmers.

# Community and Social Development

## Helping Communities, Helping Elephants Project

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many mahouts and elephants had no income, so they had to return to their hometowns. Among them was a group of a hundred mahouts from Tha Tum district, Surin province.

With the help of Krapho Sub-district Administrative Organization, ThaiBev went to talk to the community. Krapho Ruam Jai Rak Chang, a community enterprise to plant Napier grass as a food source for the elephants, was formed to help the mahouts in five villages. On the model of "One Rai, One Mahout", 120 rai were planted with support from the Forest Industry Organization in Surin. Each rai has a yield of approximately 40 tonnes of Napier grass, so around 4,800 tonnes can be planted to feed the elephants each year.

## Chumchondee Meeroiyim Project Shop (Selling Community Products Online)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ThaiBev helped communities to continue to earn income by educating them about online marketing channels and creating awareness about opportunities for selling community products. This project shop operates as an online store on the popular Line application.

So far, 603,687 Baht has been generated for the communities. There are 17 communities participating with 735 members.

# GRGI Fish Farming Project using Treated Wastewater

To support local communities, in June 2021, Grand Royal Group International (GRGI) initiated a project to farm 4,800 fish of four different species, using treated water from its wastewater treatment plant at Yangon Distillery in Hmawbi township, Myanmar. Six months later, GRGI harvested and provided the fish to surrounding villages, and invited local elders and villagers to come on an observation visit to the fish pond, to learn how treated wastewater can successfully breed and increase the growth rate of fish.

In addition to the 1,433 community projects driven by the Pracharath Rak Samakkee provincial network, there are also three projects in which the central company, Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd., works with government agencies and the private sector to create a platform to drive nationwide employment.

## Food Safety for Hospitals Project

This project has been in operation since 2017, with the Pracharath Rak Samakkee provincial network acting as the community coordinator to find safe, local sources of raw materials (vegetables and fruits). The main goal is to generate income for agriculture and community enterprises in the area by creating a market for safe fruits and vegetables. At the same time, the people of the country are healthy because they consume products of high quality that are up to standard. Currently, a network of 40 provinces participates in the project, delivering safe raw materials to 52 hospitals. 2,016 farmers benefit, generating a total income of over 280 million Baht.

Pakaoma Daranakee became well known after participating in the Local Pakaoma Handicraft Project, and Pracharath Rak Samakkee and ThaiBev helped to increase distribution channels, find space for booths, and bring products to Pracharath Rak Samakkee shops. In addition to that, last year I had the opportunity to work with students of King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang, who came to help create ideas to add value to our products. We are glad that the younger generation appreciates Pakaoma. Thank you to the Local Pakaoma Handicraft Project for enabling our community to be happy and earn more.



## Community-based Tourism Project: Following in the Footsteps of Luang Pu Man Phurithatto

Started in 2020, this project promotes tourism and invites the public to learn about the history, strict practices and, most importantly, the teachings of revered monk Luang Pu Man Phurithatto. It promotes merit-making collaboration between houses, temples, and schools and the development of community enterprise companies, under the principles of BOWON (“House, Temple, School”). The focus is on creating community-based tourism routes as well as generating sustainable community income.

The project also organizes events such as “Plant Forests in People’s Hearts”, during which 61,600 trees were planted. The event promoted the conservation of natural resources and created awareness of tourist attractions in the community, in order to develop ecotourism, volunteer tourism, and faith-based tourism in Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom and Ubon Ratchathani provinces.

The Pracharath Rak Samakkee Project demonstrates ThaiBev’s role as a leader and model organization, which operates in accordance with sustainable development practices under the principles of environmental, social and governance strategies. Performance is continuously monitored by empathizing and building good relationships with all stakeholders. This reinforces ThaiBev as the “Stable and Sustainable ASEAN Leader”.

# 2022 Highlight

## Sustainability Expo 2022 (SX 2022)

Sustainability Expo, the largest sustainability exhibition in Asia, has been organized for three consecutive years on the concept of "Sufficiency for Sustainability" with the aim to introduce the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) according to the royal initiatives of His Late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, as the core value for sustainable development activities in the region.

Sustainability Expo is based on a B2C2B (Business-to-consumer-to-business) approach which puts consumers at the core in taking actions towards sustainability. Once consumers are made aware of the needs for sustainable development by large organizations and sustainability practitioners, they will take actions and change consumption behaviors, which in turn helps to bring smaller business operators to join the sustainability ecosystem. Running from 26 September to 2 October, 2022, SX 2022 spanned over 40,000 square meters at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in Bangkok. Five leading business organizations in sustainability development collaborated on the event, namely ThaiBev, PTT Global Chemical (GC), Thai Union Group, SCG, and Frasers Property.

At SX 2022, visitors experienced the Ring of Balance route, which shared stories from pioneers and real sustainability practitioners in Thailand. Visitors learned how organizations introduce the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy as a guideline to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals such as poverty and hunger eradication, decent employment and quality education, in order to promote economic growth and innovation, tackle climate change, and promote peaceful societies. At the same time, visitors gained insights into international and national agendas for sustainability.

# SX 2022 was divided into seven main zones:

1. **SEP Inspiration Zone**  
   Reflecting sustainability policies and their components, and presenting the experiences of pioneers on sustainable development nationally and internationally.

2. **Better Living Zone**  
   Presenting projects by leading large organizations to promote the circular economy, improve environmental quality, and advance the concept of sustainable development throughout the production value chain in order to achieve Net Zero.

3. **Better Community Zone**  
   Describing societal improvements through changes in people's lifestyles, such as digital and environmental technology produced by world-leading companies, as well as innovations to develop smart cities in the future.

4. **Better Me Zone**  
   Focusing on three main components that improve the quality of life in all aspects. "Health" presented guidelines for creating good physical, mental, and emotional health through a variety of medical and other innovations. "Food" described food and beverage innovations that aim to solve food security issues. "Lifelong Learning" showcased projects to focus learning across all age segments.

5. **Food Festival Zone**  
   Featuring top chefs from the "Iron Chef", "Master Chef" programs, as well as popular restaurants to present eco-friendly food and the food of the future. An atmosphere of food streets from around the world was created, with cuisines from Thai, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and European restaurants. In addition, environmental awareness was cultivated by usage of mandatory biodegradable and environmentally friendly packaging. The Food Waste Station informed visitors about waste sorting and recycling. The "Pan Suk Refrigerator" was also set up to deliver leftover food from the shops to communities in need.

6. **Planet Kids Zone**  
   A playground for small children to learn about SDGs in a fun and informative way.

7. **Sustainable Marketplace Zone**  
   A community market of more than 200 designer shops on the concept of environmentally innovative products.

During the week of the event, there was a forum of more than 400 experts in various fields related to sustainable development from 100 leading organizations from around the world.

As the global COVID-19 pandemic continued into 2022, many SGX-listed issuers continued to hold virtual shareholder meetings for the health and protection of shareholders and staff. In May 2022, the SGX issued guidelines and revised FAQs clarifying their expectation that issuers should implement live voting and full live participation at virtual shareholder meetings, enabling shareholders to electronically attend (and appoint proxies to do so), submit questions to the issuer in advance, and participate in “live” Q&A sessions. On 21 September 2022, ThaiBev organized its Virtual Annual Information Meeting, giving directors and senior management of the group the opportunity to meet and engage virtually with our shareholders in Singapore. Our President and CEO, as well as members of senior management, delivered a comprehensive presentation covering the business and operations of ThaiBev Group, financial highlights, and our key product groups. Attendees were invited to submit their questions on the business and operations of ThaiBev Group both in advance of and during the virtual meeting, and directors and senior management provided their responses to substantial and relevant questions. ThaiBev also promptly announced its consolidated responses and the presentation slides on the SGXNET to ensure that all shareholders were kept updated.

Lastly, to emphasize its commitment to listening to feedback, ThaiBev has initiated a whistleblowing policy and contact channel for receiving complaints from the company’s directors, executives, and employees. In 2022, no significant conflicts or ethical complaints were submitted.

# Code of Business Conduct

ThaiBev established its Code of Business Conduct to pursue integrity, legal compliance, morality, and ethics, including prevention of conflicts of interest.

The company has implemented broad rules on the prevention of conflicts between personal and collective interests. As mentioned in the Employee Code of Conduct, Article 4.1, Responsibility to the Company (2), employees must not commit any act which is contrary to the interests of the company, or take any action which may cause the company to lose benefits or receive less benefits than it should, or which is a distribution of benefits from the company. In addition, Clause 15 of the employment contract stipulates that, while employed by the company and within one year of leaving, employees must agree not to do the following, except with the written consent of the company:

15.1 Hire or be an employee of a juristic person or business that is a competitor of the Company and/or the Group of Companies.

15.2 Provide any advice, consultation or assistance, or contract with any entity or business of any person that is a competitor of the Company and/or the Group of Companies, which may cause impact or damage to the business or affairs of the Company and/or Group of Companies.

15.3 Operate the same or similar business as the business of the Company and/or the Group.

ThaiBev has a duty to maintain transparency in its operations, to protect the interests of its shareholders by considering present and future market conditions and risk factors, and to treat employees, customers, and business partners ethically. The company is committed to ensuring that its personnel understand, accept, and follow its Code of Business Conduct. This will positively support:

- The company’s ability to uphold its responsibility to society and stakeholders
- Employees’ work efficiency
- Fairness within the organization
- Employees’ dignity and integrity
- The company being socially accepted
- Employees’ well-being

In 2022, the company found a total of 78 cases of disciplinary violations related to the Code of Business Conduct. There were 77 cases of offenses related to fraud and one case related to harassment.

# Anti-Corruption

Corruption is a criminal offense that affects free competition and breaches the company’s Code of Business Conduct. It causes damage to ThaiBev’s reputation, stakeholders’ confidence, and the company’s profits.

In order to ensure policy compliance, it is mandatory for all employees and suppliers to attend lectures on fraudulent conduct and corruption, and the legal consequences or employee disciplinary actions that will arise from such behavior. Self-assessment shows that ThaiBev’s operations have no significant risk related to anti-corruption.

ThaiBev operates its business transparently and morally, adheres to the principles of fairness, and complies with its Code of Business Conduct, while striving to provide maximum value for stakeholders in Thailand and abroad. ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy establishes practical protection measures and serves as a guideline to create a stable and sustainable future.

The President and CEO is responsible for monitoring and implementing an efficient anti-corruption system, reporting to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and for reviewing and revising policies to ensure they are up-to-date and responsive to any change to the business or regulations. The company has specified the roles and duties of all parties as follows:

- Senior-level executives are responsible for ensuring policy compliance and collaborate with board members, managers, and employees in compliance monitoring.
- Board members and employees have the duty to maintain the highest standards when doing business.
- Employees must not neglect evidence of corruption.
- Employees must cooperate in investigating the facts.

Failure to act in accordance with ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy is a severe disciplinary offense, violates the company’s employment contract, and is a criminal offense. Violating the anti-corruption policy can cause severe damage to the company’s reputation. If corruption is discovered, it should be reported to the employee’s line manager. Any person found to violate the policy will be disciplined in accordance with ThaiBev’s rules and prosecuted under the law.

The company conducts a transparent and rigorous investigation process as stipulated in the code of conduct, which also stipulates fair and reasonable penalties for employees who fail to observe the policy. In fiscal year 2022, there were some minor cases of employees failing to act in accordance with ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy that were detected by the company. Most of them involved intentional use by the employees of the powers of their position in order to seek undue benefit for themselves or others. Two cases resulted in a written warning. 75 cases resulted in penalties. There were no cases of fraudulent acts by partners.

# Handling Complaints

All employees are obligated to file a complaint when discovering an act that may be considered wrongdoing. Channels for filing complaints are publicized through the company's internal media. Employees who file a fair and truthful complaint shall not face any repercussions or harms from the complaint. The process of filing complaints is as follows:

- A board member should file any complaint with the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
- If an employee has a complaint, they should file it in writing with a responsible company official through the recommended channels, giving their name and contact details.
- Every employee can report suspicious information directly to the President and CEO via email at whistleblowing@thaibev.com or file the complaint to their line manager.
- Confidentiality will be maintained while taking strict action against wrongdoing.
- When an employee files a complaint, ThaiBev will decide how to proceed, which may involve an internal investigation or reporting to an external organization to conduct an investigation.
- If it is found afterwards that the complaint was false, corrupt, malicious, careless, or for personal benefit, this will be considered a disciplinary offense as stated in the ThaiBev Employee Handbook.

# Breaches of Regulations and the Law

ThaiBev requires that all employees comply with its rules and regulations, and the laws of the countries that the company operates in. Any breach of applicable regulations in terms of ethics, organizational standards of excellence, or violations of human rights on the business premises must be stopped immediately and appropriate measures taken. In 2022, some minor cases were reported (breaches are categorized by the monetary value of the action: major cases involve a monetary value of 300,000 Baht or more; minor cases involve less than 300,000 Baht).

To prevent breaches of the regulations, ThaiBev has implemented the following procedures:

- Conduct orientation for new employees and executives.
- Provide online training courses for employees.
- Communicate business ethics to employees.
- Require all employees to follow the Code of Business Conduct.
- Take decisive action when fraud is discovered as it may involve legal action.
- Conduct regular internal audits by the Internal Audit Office to ensure that ThaiBev follows rules and regulations under the law.

# Adapting to Regulatory Changes

ThaiBev Group has the office of legal Affairs to monitor regulatory and legal changes in Thailand. The Group tracks law changes through being a membership of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Thai Chambers of Commerce, and the Federation of Thai Industries, as well as seeking information, laws and news from the websites of government agencies such as the Secretariat of the Prime Minister, the Secretariat of the Cabinet, the Secretariat of the House of Representatives, the Thai government gazette, the Office of the Council of State, and the Revenue Department. In the fiscal year 2022, ThaiBev Group has adjusted its operating policy to be in line with the government's legal measures as follows:

- **Public Limited Company Act (No.4) BE 2565 (2022) (Amendment)**
  - The Act, which came into force on May 24, 2022, was amended to allow public limited companies to hold board meetings and shareholders' meetings electronically, to deliver notices and documents electronically, and for proxies at shareholders' meetings to be appointed electronically. As this is all in accordance with the principles of the Decree on Electronic Meetings BE 2563 (2020), ThaiBev Group had already organized its Board of Directors' meetings and shareholders' meetings via electronic media to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Group has chosen to use a secure electronic meeting system that complies with the security standards of electronic meetings required by law. ThaiBev Group will deliver notices and documents electronically if the directors or shareholders request or consent to the Group's submission of documents by such means. This will also lessen paper consumption, leading to a reduction in global warming.

- **Personal Data Protection Act BE 2562 (2019)**
  - On 1 June, 2022, Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act BE 2562 covering personal data protection, data subject rights, complaints, civil liability, and penalties came into effect. Accordingly, ThaiBev Group has issued a personal data protection policy, appointed a Personal Data Protection Officer, educated employees on this law, as well as developed relevant work systems to ensure that ThaiBev Group's business operations comply with the law and do not affect data subject's rights. ThaiBev Group also provides a channel for a data subject to contact about personal data protection matters.

# Corporate Governance and Business Ethics

## Notification of the Ministry of Public Health, re: Specifying the List of Narcotics of Category 5, BE 2565 (2022)

The notification was issued under the Narcotics Code to be effective from 9 June 2022 onwards, exempting from classification under category 5 extracts containing no more than 0.2% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by weight. Only extracts from domestically grown cannabis or hemp plants and their seeds are exempted. Therefore, all parts of cannabis and hemp plants e.g. barks, stems, branches, fibers, and roots as well as their leaves with young shoots or buds will no longer be classified as narcotics of category 5. In planning its business to widen its choice of products and increase its land management options for greater benefit, while ensuring sustainable growth and taking into account all stakeholders, ThaiBev Group is waiting for clear government oversight and control measures before formulating a business strategy by weighing up the positives and negatives.

## Public Policy

ThaiBev conducts business under good governance principles, with an effective management system, transparency, corporate responsibility, and impartiality. The company engages with and supports various sectors for commercial benefit and strengthened competitiveness, and has expanded its growth network with companies in the beverage and food industries. ThaiBev also offers suggestions and guidelines for the benefit of the public, the whole business, and consumers, with the intention of coordinating public and private policies to promote the sustainable development of the industry as a whole. In addition, ThaiBev makes financial and in-kind political contributions both directly and indirectly; further information can be found at sustainability.thaibev.com.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

Goals of the Code of Business Conduct:

- To achieve zero confirmed cases of disciplinary action in relation to corruption and harassment.
- To strengthen and align work processes on corporate governance, the code of business conduct, and work regulations, both in ThaiBev at group level and in affiliate companies, to be consistent and operating in the same direction.
- To develop communication and education about the company’s policies, the code of business conduct and work regulations, at the group level and in ThaiBev’s affiliate companies, to make them easier for employees to access and understand.
- To strictly monitor compliance with company policy, the code of business conduct, and work regulations by employees and suppliers.
- 100% of directors, management, employees, and suppliers to have completed anti-corruption training through the e-learning system. Each person needs to score 90% or more in testing, in order to be considered to have passed the training.

## Key Projects

### Examples of Support for Various Organizations

#### Thai Chamber of Commerce

ThaiBev collaborates with the Board of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Trade of Thailand, and a network of entrepreneurs to enhance entrepreneurial potential by linking them with important government policies, such as joining formulating trade and investment guidelines under the Thai-Vietnam Business Council, and building trust after the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. In addition, ThaiBev has demonstrated its focus on personnel development and education by initiating the Partnership School Project across the country. These are just some of ThaiBev’s initiatives that bring economic benefits to society, the company, and the industrial sector.

#### Thailand Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for a Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE), under the Federation of Thai Industries

In collaboration with TIPMSE, ThaiBev has aligned itself with the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) by signing a cooperation agreement as part of the PACKBACK project to collect packaging back for recycling. Supported by the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, and the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, as well as local government agencies in Chonburi Province, the project involves more than 70 parties in the private sector, the government sector, and the education sector. This is an important step in implementing EPR across all sectors, encouraging the return of used packaging to the recycling process to create added-value products. The program aligns with the government’s BCG (bio-circular-green) development policy, which focuses on environmentally friendly economic development to achieve Net Zero.

# Federation of Thai Industries (FTI)

ThaiBev supports the operations of the FTI every year, including sponsoring various events, supporting membership fees, and giving research grants related to packaging management. The company believes that these initiatives will help packaging to become more sustainable, under the concept of packaging as a raw material. ThaiBev advocates that all sectors separate used packaging from waste to help reduce environmental impacts.

# Thai-UK Business Leadership Council (TUBLC)

As chair of the TUBLC since June 2018, ThaiBev is committed to promoting growth and driving the economic progress of both countries, through discussions and exchanges of ideas between the public and private sectors, and the promotion of trade and investment opportunities for Thai and UK entrepreneurs. The goal is to enhance the business competitiveness of the two countries through two taskforces: the Trade and Investment Promotion Taskforce; and the Trade Policy Review Taskforce, which builds understanding of international trade regulations and pushes forward proposals on trade issues that are beneficial to both countries.

Key contributions over the past year have included meetings with the Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss, the UK’s then Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, along with representatives of the Thai private sector. Meetings with the UK Prime Minister’s Trade Envoy to Thailand, TUBLC members, the Thai Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were organized to hear opinions from the Thai private sector and to promote cooperation between the two countries.

# Thai-Vietnam Business Council

Committed to promoting good relations and emphasizing the history of peace between Thailand and Vietnam, ThaiBev supported the signing and publishing of agreements that will open a new, stronger chapter in the countries’ strategic partnership for peace, stability and mutual prosperity.

# UN Global Compact and Global Compact Network Thailand

Recognizing the importance of sustainable development in the private sector, ThaiBev joined the UN Global Compact (UNGC) on 24 July, 2019. The UNGC is the United Nations’ framework for sustainable development cooperation.

It aims to strengthen cooperation amongst companies in all industry sectors, foundations, and non-profit organizations and encourage all parties to be mindful of sustainability in their operations in line with the UNGC’s ten global principles.

These ten principles cover four key dimensions, anti-corruption, labor standards, human rights, and environmental protection. ThaiBev recognizes that the protection and conservation of natural resources and the environment are key to sustainable development. Therefore, it is committed to operating in accordance with circular economy principles. It is also dedicated to continual development of more efficient and environmentally friendly practices in energy, water, packaging materials, and waste.

ThaiBev foresees that its commitment will further increase as a member of the Global Compact Network Thailand (GCNT), if it is to help achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal 17, which refers to “cooperation for sustainable development”. In the past, the company has supported and participated in important activities for the GCNT such as publishing ThaiBev sustainability articles as models for other businesses.

# Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN)

Established in 2019 as a collaboration between seven Thai private companies, the TSCN has three key objectives: to protect the value of investment, focusing on business continuity; to enhance investment value by building partnerships and developing the efficiency of existing operations (e.g. cross-selling, cross-training, joint investment, resource-sharing); and to jointly create innovations and expand investment in collaborative projects, especially new ones (e.g. creating an online platform with venture funds for startups, cross-sharing employee skills, and using program developers). In 2022, the TSCN was again instrumental in organizing the regional sustainability exhibition, Sustainability Expo 2022, in Bangkok.

# Supply Chain Management

ThaiBev thrives to build resilient, eco-friendly and cost-effective supply chain operations through close collaboration with our partners. We focus on applying digital technology and Supplier Code of Practice to create world-class standards and transparency across our supply chain.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev's supply chain management is governed by our supply chain management strategy and our Supplier Code of Practice. ESG considerations are fully integrated into procurement, in line with the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Guideline, as follows:

- **Supplier Compliance and Sourcing**
  - ThaiBev requires 100% of our active suppliers, both new and existing, to comply with our Supplier Code of Practice and ensures that 100% of key agricultural raw materials are responsibly sourced.

- **Risk Management and Supplier Relationship**
  - ThaiBev has formalized processes to identify critical suppliers and critical materials, in order to prioritize risk management and supplier relationship management plans.

- **Sustainability Risk Management**
  - ThaiBev defines the level of sustainability risk management measures through on-site audits by either internal or external auditors, online assessment via Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM), and third-party risk databases via a consolidated supplier risk assessment and the monitoring platform CROSS Supplier Risk Management (SRM).

- **Supplier Performance Review**
  - ThaiBev reviews supplier performance from the assessment and audit results and requests corrective actions from suppliers to resolve non-compliance incidents.

- **Collaboration and Development**
  - ThaiBev collaborates with strategic business partners to enhance supplier development via the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN), by sharing knowhow in sustainable development practice.

- **Recognition of Business Partners**
  - ThaiBev continues to recognize business partners with an outstanding performance through our Business Partner Award program.

These factors emphasize the need for ThaiBev to focus on supply chain resilience and to collaborate with our business partners to manage any positive and negative economic, environmental, and social impacts in the supply chain, taking into account Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and fair treatment of business partners to avoid any human rights breaches. These impacts may include excessive use of natural resources, creating environmental pollution in the community, or supplier unfair treatment to their labor forces. Therefore, ThaiBev continues to enforce its Supplier Code of Practice and assess business partners’ sustainability risk exposure through the digital platform CROSS Procurement. This platform improves supply chain visibility and monitors business partners’ compliance, which are essential for proactively identifying the underlying risks and ensuring business continuity.

Additionally, ThaiBev has helped establish the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN), a business community for local entrepreneurs to connect, exchange knowledge, and transact in order to strengthen business partner capability, driven by sustainable development principles and in alignment with the UN SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.

# Towards 2025 and Beyond

## 2025 goals and initiatives:

- **ThaiBev commits to regularly assessing 100% of our Tier 1 suppliers** and increasing the number of suppliers completing online assessments by 2025, to better understand overall corporate risk exposure and to manage resources and develop suppliers more effectively.

- **ThaiBev aims to responsibly source 100% of our key agricultural raw materials** (i.e., malt and hops, sugar, broken rice, tea leaves, and palm oil) by 2025.

## 2030 goals:

- **100% of strategic suppliers** to have their own supplier code of conduct implemented.

- **100% of active suppliers** to be assessed and examined for sustainability risks by a third party or using third-party risk databases.

## Beyond 2030:

- **Net zero on Scope 3 emissions by 2050.**

# Supply Chain Management Strategy

ThaiBev’s supply chain management strategy is designed to be in line with PASSION 2025 and the company’s vision to become a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader in the food and beverage industry. The strategy consists of five pillars, as follows:

- **Visibility**
  - Integrate the digital system suite into total supply chain management for real-time visibility, including predictive risk management, procurement spending, profitability, efficiency, and traceable ESG impacts in the supply chain.

- **Synergy**
  - Engage with business partners to expand the adoption of sustainable business practices and strengthen Thailand’s business sector through multi-stakeholder collaborations and digital solutions.

- **Integrated Risk Management**
  - Improve overall business resilience and ensure business continuity by having multiple qualified suppliers in place, particularly those supplying critical materials and key agricultural raw materials, giving priority to local sources and strengthening the capability of domestic suppliers.

- **Centralized Management**
  - Harmonize the global procurement policy, operating model, and technology to maximize values throughout the supply chain, in both economic and sustainability aspects.

- **Standardization**
  - Integrate leading procurement standards into supply chain management (i.e., ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement) and develop workers’ capabilities with specialized skill sets and increased sustainability awareness.

# 2022 Highlight

## Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN)

Following the founding of the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) by ThaiBev and its strategic business partners in 2019, TSCN continues to expand its community through the implementation of the TSCN Platform, which uses online channels to approach local business partners to become members.

The TSCN Platform presents itself as an enabler for local entrepreneurs to transition to a more sustainable business model. Its "Sustainability Knowledge Sharing" section allows members and the public to access knowhow provided by TSCN members, who are leaders in their own industries. This can help businesses improve their operations and products, in order to meet consumers’ demands for green alternatives and contribute to Thailand’s national agenda of transitioning towards the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) business model. The other key feature on the platform is the "Sustainable E-Marketplace", which allows TSCN members to upload their products or services so that the platform can provide suggestions for business matching. This can become another important sales channel for members, particularly during the current economic turbulence and commodity price rise crisis. In addition, TSCN members can label their products as "Green Products" to attract customers who are looking for sustainable product alternatives.

In 2022, ThaiBev and the other TSCN co-founders invited their business partners to become TSCN Platform members, in order to have access to sustainability knowledge and training, as well as connect with other TSCN members for business opportunities and collaborations. TSCN now has over 900 members from many industries ranging from large conglomerates to small and medium-sized enterprises.

Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (GC), Thai Union Group Public Company Limited, SCG Public Company Limited, and Fraser Property Company Limited, as well as TSCN, joined forces to organize the regional Sustainability Expo (SX) 2022 from 26 September to 2 October, 2022, at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center. The objectives were to create a positive collaboration platform and impactful engagement with multiple stakeholders, in order to drive the Decade of Action on the Sufficiency for Sustainability approach and to advance the concept of "Good Balance, Better World".

TSCN organized "SX Partnerships for the Goals: TSCN Business Partner Conference 2022" as part of SX 2022 on 1 October, 2022, to share leading corporate sustainability practices and to recognize TSCN members with an outstanding sustainability performance. The event featured a panel discussion on the theme of "Leading Sustainable Business", with the CEOs from the five leading TSCN co-founders sharing their perspectives on driving their organizations towards sustainability.

# Key Projects

## ThaiBev Business Partner Award 2022

These annual awards aim to promote supplier development, private sector competitiveness, sustainable business practices, and innovation. The contenders for the awards are ThaiBev’s strategic business partners, including critical suppliers, suppliers with strong business relationships, and high-volume suppliers. The awards are divided into three tiers: Silver, Gold, and Platinum (business partners who receive a Gold Award for three consecutive years).

In 2022, ThaiBev added a requirement for program participants to track and provide their greenhouse gas emission data, which represent ThaiBev’s Scope 3 emissions.

The awards ceremony took place at “SX Partnerships for the Goals: TSCN Business Partner Conference 2022”. Chief Supply Chain Management Thailand delivered a speech on “Partnerships for a Sustainable Tomorrow” to outline ThaiBev’s expectations for its business partners and the need for collaboration to achieve sustainability commitments, which include ThaiBev’s Net Zero commitment on Scope 3 emissions.

## CROSS Invoice

ThaiBev has implemented an integrated digital procurement solution to enhance overall procurement capability, efficiency, and transparency. It covers end-to-end procurement processes from supplier registration, supplier qualification, bidding and award, and documentation (purchase order issuance and invoicing), to supplier evaluation.

In 2022, ThaiBev introduced CROSS Invoice, an online billing and invoicing feature designed to improve efficiency and transparency in the procurement process, as well as help ease suppliers’ workloads in the billing and invoicing paperwork. CROSS Invoice allows suppliers to submit their invoicing document, track their invoicing status, and confirm the payment date online.

# Achievements

Economic turbulence and uncertainty from geopolitical conflicts, global supply chain disruptions, and cash flow shortages have been forcing suppliers, in particular smaller businesses, to optimize their resources and put any unnecessary investment on hold. This prevents ThaiBev’s business partners from having dedicated resources to push forward their adoption of corporate sustainability. ThaiBev is aware of the challenges they have been facing and is committed to the following ESG objectives to advance business partners’ adoption of sustainable business practices:

1. Business partner development and collaboration
2. Supply chain transparency and impact management
3. Compliance with sustainable sourcing policy
4. Sustainable procurement

## 1. Business Partner Development and Collaboration

- ThaiBev develops and collaborates with our business partners through many communication and engagement channels, such as TSCN, Sustainability Expo 2022, and the Business Partner Award program. These activities are implemented to ensure business partners’ alignment with ThaiBev’s sustainability standards and to minimize any negative ESG impacts throughout the supply chain.

- ThaiBev continues to follow a policy of encouraging sourcing from local business partners for sustainability and economic reasons. ThaiBev aims to reduce environmental impacts by optimizing transportation distances and fuel consumption, and limiting pollution. This also helps boost income distribution and job creation among SME suppliers in the surrounding communities.

### Key Statistics

- **277,023** participants at Sustainability Expo 2022
- **> 900** TSCN members in 2022
- **61%** of strategic suppliers in Business Partner Award program track their greenhouse gas emissions
- **96%** of procurement comes from local suppliers (suppliers who operate in Thailand)

## 2. Supply Chain Transparency and Impact Management

- ThaiBev has formalized processes to identify our critical suppliers annually in order to develop supplier relationship management strategies, together with the prioritization of resources and supplier risk management. Factors to define critical suppliers include the level of the supplier’s sustainability maturity, the supplier’s business goals (and their alignment with ThaiBev’s goals), suppliers that provide critical materials, suppliers that are non-substitutable, and the interdependency between ThaiBev and the supplier. This enables ThaiBev to identify and mitigate potential risks in the procurement process throughout the supply chain.

### Key Statistics

- **100%** of critical suppliers undergo comprehensive ESG assessment
- **11%** of suppliers identified with high ESG risk exposure which accounts for 5% of total procurement spend

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2022

- ThaiBev uses CROSS SRM (Supplier Risk Management) to assess supplier risks and report holistic supplier risk profiles in multiple dimensions: sustainability, regulatory, financial, and operational risks, using both internal and third-party databases to calculate the risk score. This helps ThaiBev to identify suppliers with high risks, who have the potential to cause negative environmental and social impacts in the supply chain. The common issues found among high-risk suppliers are the lack of formalized sustainability requirements or management measures for their own suppliers which are ThaiBev’s non-tier 1 suppliers. In addition, audited suppliers with major non-compliance incidents are suspended until corrective actions are taken that satisfy ThaiBev’s requirements.

| 100% of active Tier 1 suppliers acknowledge and accept the ThaiBev Supplier Code of Practice | 75% of strategic Tier 1 suppliers have their own supplier code of conduct in place |

## 3. Compliance with Sustainable Procurement Policy

- ThaiBev considers sustainability factors in all aspects of our procurement process and requires suppliers to comply with the Supplier Code of Practice and undergo strict supplier screening, which includes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and quality assurance processes. This applies to 100% of ThaiBev’s suppliers. ThaiBev also makes sustainability a criterion in supplier qualification, bidding, and supplier performance evaluation. ThaiBev extends the requirements for critical and strategic suppliers in the ThaiBev Business Partner Award program to include the implementation of their own supplier code of conduct in alignment with ThaiBev’s, in order to ensure ESG compliance among ThaiBev’s non-Tier 1 suppliers.

| 100% of key agricultural raw materials sustainably sourced |

## 4. Sustainable Agriculture

- ThaiBev selects quality raw materials for our alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, and food production through a socially and environmentally responsible procurement process in line with top global standards, such as BonSucro, SEDEX, RSPO, SAI Platform, and Rainforest Alliance. ThaiBev’s key agricultural raw materials include malt and hops, sugar, broken rice, palm oil, and tea leaves. We have established sourcing requirements to procure these key raw materials from qualified suppliers operating in accordance with the aforementioned standards. The requirements are included in the following procurement processes: supplier qualification, bidding submission, and supplier evaluation.

- We are committed to working with suppliers, including farmers, to initiate programs to mitigate the impacts of climate change and natural disasters, which affect the quantity and price of their raw agricultural materials, as well as the farmers’ incomes and general well-being.

# Green Logistics

Transport and logistics are responsible for approximately 16% of global GHG emissions. As distribution is one of the key activities in ThaiBev’s value chain, we recognize the importance of implementing sustainable logistics and are committed to minimizing the environmental impact and carbon footprint of our logistics activities, from both in-house and outsourced services. In-house logistics is managed by a ThaiBev subsidiary called Thai Beverage Logistics Co., Ltd. (TBL).

## Management Approach

ThaiBev’s distribution operations are managed in alignment with the supply chain management strategy: visibility, synergy, integrated risk management, centralized management, and standardization in line with PASSION 2025. In addition, ThaiBev has established three priorities for distribution management to ensure operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and continuous stakeholder engagement throughout the supply chain:

1. **Strengthen our logistics capability** to increase efficiency and enhance process automation using AI for cost-effectiveness.
2. **Increase direct-to-consumer presence** to adapt to changing consumer behavior and personalization trends.
3. **Enhance route-to-market** through digitalization to empower traditional trade channels and support future delivery models.

For our outsourced logistics operation, ThaiBev has formalized management measures to ensure that our outsourced logistics providers operate in compliance with our sustainability standards. They are required to accept ThaiBev’s Supplier Code of Practice and complete sustainability assessments that address ESG issues such as human rights, occupational health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy efficiency prior to the start of service provision. This is to ensure that 100% of ThaiBev’s outsourced logistics providers are screened using social and environmental criteria in compliance with the ThaiBev Supplier Code of Practice.

ThaiBev also tracks our outsourced providers’ driving behavior and performance using an online application, with the main focus on safe driving. In addition, to have full visibility of ThaiBev’s ESG impacts, we collect Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data from these providers under the category “Upstream, and Downstream Transportation and Distribution”.

## 2022 Highlight

### Electric Truck and Electric Material Handling Equipment (MHE)

In 2022, ThaiBev piloted a transition from internal combustion engine to Electric Vehicle (EV). The EV truck was used to transport products from one of ThaiBev’s warehouses to customers. With over 11,000 km on the odometer, the EV truck has so far helped to avoid 4,400 kgCO₂e. In addition, ThaiBev has been replacing the LPG forklifts used in our warehouse with electrically powered forklifts that have solar-rooftop charging stations. There are currently 29 electric forklifts in use, with an additional 40 to be introduced in the coming year. Moving forward, ThaiBev will continue to increase the proportion of the corporate electric vehicles as one among the key initiatives to achieve ThaiBev’s net zero commitment in scope 1 and 2 by 2040.

# Electric Truck’s Pilot Operation Results

- **96** Operating days
- **1.64** Trips / Day (Average trips during pilot operation)
- **>11,000 km** Total transporting distance
- **4,400 kgCO₂e** GHG emission avoided

## Achievements

To affirm our commitment to minimizing the environmental and social impact of our logistics operations, we integrate three ESG objectives into our distribution management priorities:

1. **Logistics Transition to Zero Emissions**
2. **Logistics Optimization**
3. **Stakeholder Collaboration and Development**

### 1. Logistics Transition to Zero Emissions

ThaiBev have installed a solar rooftop and LED lights which consume 75% less energy than normal lightbulbs at its regional distribution center in Lampang province. This has helped reduce the proportion of the non-renewable electricity purchased from the provincial authority by more than 50%. In 2023, ThaiBev plans to install solar rooftops at distribution centers in Ayutthaya, Samut Prakan, Nakhon Ratchasima and Surat Thani.

### 2. Logistics Optimization

- As part of the agent development program, ThaiBev liaises with distributors to plan their routes so that they can pick up products directly from ThaiBev’s warehouses using backhauls. In 2022, 371,095 deadhead kilometers were avoided, reducing fuel consumption by 2.4 million liters. ThaiBev also uses backhaul logistics to transport used glass bottles to minimize the environmental impacts through effective route planning and area management. Fourteen million used glass bottles were collected and transported using backhaul logistics.

- ThaiBev has implemented the Certu System in 2022 to help modernize the logistics processes, automate the workflow, and gain access to real-time visibility of our logistics operation. Using real-time and predictive insights based on AI and data analytics, the platform can help optimize logistics processes through, for example, matching a truck to the nearest shipment, whether out-bound or backhaul, thereby reducing empty kilometers and improving overall efficiency and cost competitiveness of the entire logistics operations.

### 3. Stakeholder Collaboration and Development

In 2021, ThaiBev collaborated with Siam Cement Group (SCG), one of our strategic business partners and one of the TSCN co-founders, to establish "Logistics Development School", a professional driving school for both in-house and outsourced truckers. The school employs experienced instructors and provides training facilities in compliance with the Department of Land Transport standards. As part of the training, drivers learn fuel-efficient driving techniques, which not only help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also improve road safety.

# Risk Management

Businesses today face many challenges and uncertainties. After recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, intensifying geopolitical conflicts affecting trade, technological innovation and economic growth have become critical challenges. The global food and beverage industry has faced significant disruptions in its supply chain, alongside rapid changes in consumer behaviors. Other disruptive currents include accelerating digitalization, cyberthreats, inflation and commodity price volatility. Risk management in the face of these uncertainties needs to encompass both defensive and proactive measures to ensure business continuity and resilience.

ThaiBev works diligently to manage risks through our sustainability strategy and human rights principles to explore opportunities and mitigate impacts from economic volatility, and changes in environmental and social factors. Our ultimate goal for risk management is to respond efficiently to challenges through our journey to become Stable and Sustainable ASEAN Leader in the beverage and food business.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev develops and implements our sustainability and risk management framework in line with the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework, comprising three key components:

## ThaiBev's Sustainability and Risk Management Framework

1. **Governance Structure**
2. **Holistic Sustainability and Risk Management Process**
3. **Sustainability and Risk Management Culture**

### 1. Governance Structure

ThaiBev’s sustainability and risk governance starts from the Board of Directors and involves a range of committees, Product Groups, and Functional Groups to ensure complete coverage of issues. The Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (“SRMC”) acts as the main communication point where all identified strategic operations and ESG-related risks, impacts, and opportunities are gathered for further company-wide assessment and management.

To ensure effective oversight of ThaiBev sustainability and risk management, in the fiscal year 2022 the Board of Directors appointed two distinguished external experts as advisors to the SRMC, and established a dedicated new position of Chief Sustainability and Strategy, to orchestrate ThaiBev Group’s strategy and transformation integrally with our sustainability and risk management. Chief Sustainability and Strategy also serves as a SRMC member and Secretary to the SRMC.

### 2. Holistic Sustainability and Risk Management Process

ThaiBev proactively manages sustainability and risks across the organization from the enterprise-wide, Product Groups and Functional Groups, both at strategic and operational levels. Our sustainability and risk management includes monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating global trends, risk factors, particularly ESG-related risk factors, and peers’ actions, as well as managing uncertainties throughout the value chain. The company’s sustainability and risk management process comprises the following steps:

- Understanding business context and setting aligned objectives for ThaiBev Group, Product Groups, and Functional Groups
- Identifying both principal and emerging risks and opportunities for achieving the specified objectives, and using scenarios and stress-testing exercises to assess their potential impacts on ThaiBev and our stakeholders
- Setting and implementing action plans, together with controls according to the determined countermeasures, while exploiting opportunities in line with our strategies and sustainability objectives
- Monitoring, reporting, and evaluating the results of sustainability and risk management actions at least on a quarterly basis

### 3. Sustainability and Risk Management Culture

ThaiBev governs and promotes sustainability and risk management culture through training and other engagement activities for executives and employees throughout the organization. The aim is to create awareness of the importance of sustainability and risk management to encourage engagement in these areas. Employees can report potential risks or any concerns to their supervisor in the first instance, or through the recommended channels such as whistleblowing@thaibev.com. In addition, ThaiBev has integrated sustainability and/or risk management metrics that are aligned with the group’s targets into all executives’ annual performance assessment in areas such as:

- Environment – Energy Management, Water Stewardship
- Social – Employee Safety, Health & Well-being, Human Capital Development

Sustainability and/or risk management metrics are weighted at 10–15% of both our executives’ and employees’ annual performance assessment.

# 2022 Highlight

ThaiBev has integrated material sustainability issues into our holistic risk management process by identifying risks under three categories: Strategic, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), and Operational. Potential downside and opportunities in relation to the company's strategic objectives are identified and prioritized. In addition, we focus on emerging risks which may impact us on a mid- or even long-term basis. The identified risks and emerging risks are managed as part of Enterprise Risk Management. The outcome of this process indicates significant risks and emerging risks that require the company to pay close attention and adopt effective mitigations, including adapting our strategy and/or business model. For the risks with an unchanged or lower risk level, ThaiBev will continue to monitor and analyze changes in risk level periodically.

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

In the context of environmental pressures, societal uncertainties, and geopolitical tensions that are growing in severity and frequency, traditional risk management, which focuses on planning and reducing vulnerabilities to well-defined risks, must be expanded to include resilience management by planning for the unexpected, building up response capabilities in advance, and facilitating adaptation, as well as speeding recovery from the adverse events or disruptions. To manage the business and create a competitive advantage that drives superior performance through crisis and current climate change demands, ThaiBev has built the following core resilience areas and incorporated them into our operational policies and procedures.

# 1. Financial Resilience

ThaiBev has balanced short- and longer-term financial spending. A solid capital position and sufficient liquidity enable us to cope with potential scenarios of rapid drops in revenue, increased cost, or liquidity issues. We are able to achieve superior margins by increasing revenue through new sales channels, as well as controlling unnecessary costs.

# 2. Operational Resilience

ThaiBev has maintained robust production capacity that can pivot to meet changes in demand or remain stable in the face of operational disruption, without compromising quality. We have also paid attention to our supply chain and delivery mechanisms, particularly engagement and collaboration with business partners, in order to maintain operational capacity and the provision of goods and services to customers, even under pressures ranging from failures of individual suppliers or distributors to natural disasters and geopolitical events.

# 3. Technological Resilience

ThaiBev has invested in strong, secure, and flexible technological infrastructure to manage cyber threats and avoid technology breakdowns. We maintain and make use of available information and comply with all regulatory requirements. IT projects on a variety of scales have been continuously implemented to keep pace with customer needs, competitive demands, and regulatory requirements. At the same time, we uplift our employees’ digital technology skills, and maintain business continuity and disaster recovery capability to avoid service disruptions for customers and internal operations.

# 4. Organizational and Reputational Resilience

Stakeholders keep organizations accountable for their actions, brand promise, and stance on ESG issues. ThaiBev has established a strong mission, values, and strategies that guide its actions in terms of business conduct and ESG practices. We are open in listening to and communicating with stakeholders, anticipating and addressing societal expectations.

# 5. Business Model Resilience

ThaiBev has developed business models that can adapt to dynamic and uncertain environments, significant shifts in consumer demand, competitive landscape, technological changes, and regulatory terrain. This aligns with our PASSION 2025 commitment through:

- Building new capabilities by innovating to enhance our business and service model, product offerings, and sales channels, as well as by partnering with stakeholders on sustainability initiatives.
- Strengthening our leadership positions and competitiveness in core markets (i.e. Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, and Malaysia), by creating a sustainable supply chain, innovating and digitalizing processes, and focusing on brand portfolio management.
- Unlocking potential to enhance shareholder value by building partnerships, creating asset value, and developing a highly skilled and talented workforce.

# 6. Climate Resilience

In recent years, climate change-related risks have become widely known throughout the organization. ThaiBev is working hard to identify the specific impacts of climate change on the organization, including estimating its financial impact and building climate-related capabilities. In 2022, ThaiBev started building capacity on qualitative and quantitative climate risk assessment through trainings and workshops in order to identify business-specific climate physical and transition risks. ThaiBev will ensure that it reviews climate-related risks annually and re-conducts scenario analysis of climate transition and physical risks as needed to estimate climate-related financial impacts and drive our energy, water and climate implementation/adaptation plans.

In addition, foresight capabilities are required to build the above types of resilience successfully. ThaiBev has engaged with stakeholders to obtain feedback, input and expertise in respect to processes, procedures and proposed solutions, gathered and studied the relevant data, developed scenarios and stress testing to discover gaps in resilience, and used them to anticipate and prepare for future crises in advance. Appropriate crisis response capabilities are then pursued and applied quickly and effectively in case of disruptions.

# Information Technology and Cyber Security

With the rise of working from home during the COVID pandemic, digital connectivity and information technology have become even more important for organizations. Different locations, working environments, Internet providers and devices make it necessary for organizations to be more stringent about network security to enable employees to work worry-free anywhere in the world without fear of compromising the company’s confidential information.

The essential step is to recognize IT risk as one of the risks the organization must closely monitor. Furthermore, organizations need to gain the cooperation of their employees and relevant stakeholders in order to maintain network security.

Also, corporate stakeholders’ personal data needs to be handled with special care, in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and company regulations, to avoid infringement on human rights and face legal penalties including corporate reputation risk.

ThaiBev is also committed to managing its IT operation in an environmentally friendly manner to align with the organization's carbon-reduction policy and objective.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev has implemented cyber risk management and information security protocols in line with international standards such as ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. These global frameworks deliver principles and best practices of cyber risk management to enhance the security of the organization and help the organization effectively plan, prevent, detect and respond to threats quickly and systematically, enabling businesses to continue to operate.

# ThaiBev’s Cyber Security Committee

ThaiBev’s governance structure for cyber security strategy and review starts with the CEO, who leads the formulation of short- and long-term strategy to the Board of Directors. At the executive level, the Chief Information & Security Officer (CI&SO) and Data Protection Officer (DPO) are responsible for all assurance activities related to the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of customer, business partner, employee, and business information. There are protocols with clear delegation of responsibility and authority to prevent IT system failures and major cyber security incidents.

As ThaiBev considers cyber security threats as one of the company’s strategic risks, the Cyber Security Committee, led by the CEO, has been established to oversee cyber security operations within the company and ensure regular coordination with the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC).

The Cyber Security Committee is responsible for oversight of cyber security risks and provides strategy, plans, and policies relating to the governance of those risks. It must comply with the organization’s risk management policy, supervised by the SRMC. In addition, the Cyber Security Committee reports its performance and progress to the SRMC and the Board of Directors regularly, to ensure that all cyber security incidents are monitored, reviewed, and mitigated as planned.

# LRQA Independent Assurance Statement

**Relating to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for the fiscal year 2022 (1st October 2021 – 30th September 2022)**

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.

## Terms of engagement

LRQA (Thailand) Limited was commissioned by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev), to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report ("the report") against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000\* and uses the following principles of - inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and reliability of performance data.

Our assurance engagement covered ThaiBev’s operations and activities in Thailand, Myanmar, and United Kingdom specifically the following requirements:

- Confirming that the report is reference to GRI Standards 2021
- Evaluating the reliability of data and information for only the selected environmental and social indicators listed below:
  - **Economic**: GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed (community investment)
  - **Environmental**: GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization, GRI 302-3 Energy intensity, GRI 303-2 (2018 edition) Water withdrawal, GRI 303-4 (2018 edition) Water discharge, GRI 303-5 (2018 edition) Water consumption, GRI 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, GRI 305-5 Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3, Category 1-7, 9,11-12 and 15 only), GRI 305-4 GHG emissions intensity, GRI 306-3 (2020 edition) Waste generated, GRI 306-4 (2020 edition) Waste diverted from disposal and GRI 306-5 (2020 edition) Waste directed to disposal included food loss and food waste.
  - **Social**: GRI 403-2 (2018 edition) Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system, GRI 403-9 (2018 edition) Work-related injuries, GRI 403-10 (2018 edition) Work-related ill health, GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee, GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews, GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs and non- GRI Vulnerability Assessment for IT security.

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the report.

LRQA’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived. Ultimately, the report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

## LRQA’s Opinion

Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not, in all material respects:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier.

**Note**: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

## LRQA’s approach

LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Assessing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement to confirm that issues raised by stakeholders were captured correctly. We did this by interviewing ThaiBev’s Management who engage directly with stakeholder groups as well as reviewing documents and associated records.

\* GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2022

- **Auditing ThaiBev’s data management systems** to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or mis-statements in the data. This was done by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal verification. Discussions were held with key personnel responsible for compiling the data and drafting the report.
- **Collaboration of the third-party report** for ThaiBev’s IT security Vulnerability Assessment in May 2022.
- **Confirming the reliability** of the selected specific standards’ data by sampling evidence at:

  **Spirit & Beer Group:**
  - Kankwan Company Limited, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand
  - Sangsom Company Limited, Nakhonpathom Province, Thailand
  - Beer Thip Brewery (1991) Company Limited, Ayutthaya Province, Thailand

  **Non-Alcoholic Beverage Group:**
  - Sermsuk Public Company Limited, Suratthani and Pathumthani Provinces, Thailand
  - Thai Drinks Company Limited, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand
  - Oishi Trading Company Limited, Saraburi Province, Thailand

  **Supply Chain Management Operations:**
  - Thai Beverage Energy Company Limited, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand
  - Thai Beverage Recycle Company Limited, Ayutthaya Province, Thailand
  - Thai Beverage Logistics Company Limited, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand

**Note:**
1. LRQA did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations.
2. Data for United Kingdom and Myanmar were reviewed remotely.

## Observations

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:

- **Reliability:**  
  Data management systems are established and centralized for the data and information collection and calculation associated with the selected GRI indicators. However, it is believed that periodic internal verification will help improve the quality and reliability of data reported in the future, typically for reporting of water and waste management performance.

## LRQA’s Standards, Competence and Independence

LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.

This verification is the only work undertaken by LRQA for ThaiBev and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.

| Term | Definitions |
|------|-------------|
| Renewable Energy | Energy from sources that can be replenished at a reasonable rate, such as wastewater, solar, wind, etc. |
| Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) | Climate-related scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use/land cover. RCPs can be used to predict future possible climate-related scenarios based on the trajectory of greenhouse gas concentrations. |
| Reverse Osmosis | Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water-filtration process through membrane filters where pressure forces water molecules to move from higher concentration passing through semipermeable membranes to a lower concentration. It is the opposite of the osmosis process. |
| Strategic supplier | Suppliers with high purchase values annually and have impacts on business operations, according to the Kraljic Matrix Principle. |
| Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) | Presents the most desirable scenario in terms of human and global safety whereby nations work together to successfully limit climate change to "well below 2°C", by transforming the energy market and addressing air pollution. |
| Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) | An organization with the goal of developing a set of voluntary climate-related financial risk disclosures. These disclosures would ideally be adopted by companies which would help inform investors and other members of the public about the risks they face related to climate change. The organization was formed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a means of coordinating disclosures among companies impacted by climate change. According to the organization's website, the disclosure recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. |
| Water Demand | Demands for water consumption. |
| Water Sustainability Assessments (WSA) | A detailed assessment performed at sites to study the interaction of stakeholders in the region with local water sources. The assessment studies on-site practices and their impacts on the water body and other stakeholders, as well as the practice of other stakeholders. Environmental data such as meteorology, terrain, and aquifers are also studied to predict the sustainability of water supply in the region at the current time and in the future. |
| Watershed | The area that is surrounded by water boundary and collects water from major rivers on that basin. When it rains the water will flow from the watershed to different levels of water body, from sub-order, order to mainstream, and finally to the outlet level where water releases to the estuary. |
| Wetland | Wetland is a natural wastewater treatment system. Its advantages include no sophistication, does not require high wastewater treatment technology, high efficiency in treatment of organic substances, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, suspended solids, and heavy metals. It is also less costly in terms of system construction, operation, and maintenance. This wastewater treatment uses natural process in combination with cropping such as sedge grass, vetiver grass, Bulrush, and reed. |
