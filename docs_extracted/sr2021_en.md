# Message from the CEO

The year 2021 was once again defined by the global COVID-19 pandemic and alarming reports about our changing climate. These two pressing challenges have defined and disrupted businesses across the world in unprecedented ways and affected the fabric of all our lives. At ThaiBev, these hurdles have inspired renewed passion and fresh business strategies, as well as provided us with an opportunity to carefully consider how we can contribute to a better future for everyone.

At the heart of ThaiBev’s plan to meet these important challenges and emerge stronger than ever is our unwavering commitment to be a “Stable and Sustainable ASEAN leader”, a regional leader in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. Constant assessment and improvement in these three areas have allowed ThaiBev to not only become a more responsible, efficient, and resilient business, but also reaffirmed our mission to “Create and Share the Value of Growth”. In this past year, as corporations moved beyond assuming “responsibility” by taking on “leadership” roles on key sustainability issues, ThaiBev has found itself in an outstanding position to continue and expand its own ESG activities.

All of these strategies are driven by our continued commitment to take the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy of our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, as our guiding principle, and further guided by His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua’s first royal command to continue, sustain, and develop this legacy for the benefit and happiness of the people. This approach means our decisions must be carefully considered and have a measurable positive impact on the planet and society.

As one of ASEAN’s largest food and beverage businesses, ThaiBev takes its leadership role on these global issues seriously, and in the past year we have marked several milestones in ThaiBev’s sustainability journey. For example, ThaiBev launched its Climate Strategy, which consists of three pillars: Climate Change Adaptation, to ensure ThaiBev is resilient in the face of ongoing climate change and shifts that will occur in the medium to long term; Climate Change Mitigation, comprising ThaiBev’s efforts to minimize the effects of climate change and ensure a smooth transition to a low carbon economy; and Communities, which encapsulates ThaiBev’s determination to support local communities and conserve the environment in areas near its production sites.

In addition, we have stepped up our own internal monitoring and assessments of ESG issues. Two actions stand out in particular. First, ThaiBev publicly released its inaugural Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) compliant report; and second, ThaiBev screened and disclosed Scope 3 emissions for the first time, revealing key areas of focus for emission reduction opportunities in the coming years, as well as the success of initiatives ThaiBev has already implemented. This year’s Sustainability Report also includes new commitments to manage our water footprint, reduce food loss and waste, and protect biodiversity.

As ThaiBev joins the world in addressing the climate challenge, the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to add stress to systems, transform traditional business models, and challenge how we conduct our lives. In ASEAN, no one has been left unaffected as the severity of the outbreak increased in 2021. To support our employees, suppliers, partners, and the public health of the wider community, ThaiBev established a COVID-19 Situation Room to ensure direct engagement and extensive, active outreach on the many challenges raised by the pandemic, from maintaining supply chain continuity to extending assistance on vaccination drives.

Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, various opportunities were also identified, leading to the development of new technology innovations, logistics improvements, and an increased focus on the well-being, good health, and safety practices of our team.

Overall, ThaiBev looks ahead to this challenging decade with a clear sense of purpose. Sustainability, innovation, and ESG responsibility are essential to both ThaiBev’s and the world’s future success. As the climate challenge and the COVID-19 pandemic have illustrated, business, society, and the environment are more interconnected than ever. That is why ThaiBev stands ready and poised to contribute on all aspects of ESG and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as an employer, a corporate citizen, and a business leader in the region. I wish to personally thank all of our employees, suppliers, partners, and stakeholders for your unified sense of leadership and dedication to this mission.

**Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi**  
President and CEO



# Board Statement

The Board of Directors (the **"Board"**) is fully committed to supporting and enhancing the sustainability practices of Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (**"ThaiBev"**) through the careful consideration of environmental, social, and governance (**"ESG"**) issues that affect not only ThaiBev’s operations, but also the well-being of all ThaiBev stakeholders.

The Board believes that the private sector has a duty to contribute to the betterment of society and that ESG considerations must be more integral than ever in ThaiBev’s strategies and value creation initiatives, especially amid heightened business risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. The Board thus fully endorses the initiatives put forward by the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee to improve ThaiBev’s ESG performance.

Given the intertwining link between ThaiBev’s business activities and the climate, the Board supports the greater disclosure provided in ThaiBev’s first compliance report published in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. The report will enable stakeholders to better understand ThaiBev’s exposure to climate-related risks and how it manages such risks.

The Board was inspired by the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy of our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, as our guiding principle, and further guided by His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua’s first royal command to continue, sustain, and develop this legacy for the benefit and happiness of the people. As the COVID-19 pandemic became more severe in 2021, the Board supported ThaiBev as it took on a leadership role to provide aid and support to ThaiBev and the Thai people.

To ensure that the business is agile and responsive to all crises, supply chains remain secure, and all our operations uphold ThaiBev’s values for the benefit of all our stakeholders, the Board supervises and provides guidance to the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee. It also receives regular reports from the Committee and the ThaiBev management team on their sustainability objectives, targets, initiatives, challenges, progress, and achievements. The Board has made it clear that its evaluation of management performance takes into account their effectiveness in delivering on the commitments made to sustainability initiatives and targets.

The Board is committed to being transparent, clear, and open about ThaiBev’s businesses to its shareholders and all its stakeholders. The disclosures made in this report and in ThaiBev’s annual report adhere to this commitment. In this report, we discuss ThaiBev’s efforts to exercise good governance, risk management, and environmental practices, and to continue strengthening ThaiBev’s collaboration with business partners to drive positive economic, environmental, and social impacts from our Thailand and overseas operations.

We look forward to sharing our progress with you.

Board of Directors  
Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

# About ThaiBev

Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (“ThaiBev” or the “Group”) is Southeast Asia’s leading beverage producer and distributor and the largest in Thailand. The Company’s vision is to be a world-class total beverage company embodying commercial excellence, continuous product development and premiumization, and professionalism.

ThaiBev was listed on the Singapore Exchange Mainboard in 2006. In 2012, the Company expanded beyond Thailand with its acquisition of Fraser and Neave, Limited, a well-established conglomerate with a portfolio of highly recognized beverage brands. In 2017, ThaiBev further strengthened its regional presence by acquiring stakes in the Grand Royal Group (“GRG”), the largest whisky player in Myanmar, and in Saigon Beer-Alcohol-Beverage Corporation (“SABECO”), a leading beer producer in Vietnam, which makes ThaiBev the largest beer player by volume in Southeast Asia.

Today, ThaiBev’s business comprises four segments – spirits, beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and food. In Thailand, the Group operates 19 distilleries, 3 breweries, and 21 non-alcoholic beverage production facilities and is supported by an extensive distribution network spanning 500,000 points of sale. ThaiBev is present in over 90 countries, including 5 production facilities in Scotland which are known for producing single malt scotch whiskies such as Balblair, Old Pulteney, and Speyburn; 2 production facilities in Myanmar; and 1 distillery in China which produces the famous Yulinquan Chinese spirit.

The Company’s well-known spirits brands include Ruang Khao, Hong Thong, Blend 285, SangSom, and Mekhong, as well as GRG’s iconic Grand Royal whisky. Chang, the Group’s signature beer, is one of the most recognizable Thai beers locally and internationally, while SABECO’s Bia Saigon and 333 are Vietnam’s top-selling beer brands. ThaiBev’s leading non-alcoholic beverage brands include OISHI green tea, est cola, and Crystal drinking water, as well as F&N’s sparkling drinks and 100PLUS isotonic drink. The Company also operates Japanese restaurants, as well as ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat food businesses, through its subsidiary OISHI Group Public Company Limited. ThaiBev is accelerating the expansion of its food business by leveraging its subsidiary Food of Asia and its franchise outlets under KFC, the most popular quick service restaurant brand in Thailand.

ThaiBev is one of the top 10 largest companies on the Singapore Exchange by market capitalization and a constituent of the Straits Times Index. It is also part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (“DJSI”) World family and the DJSI Emerging Markets family.

# Insights

As ThaiBev embarks on the next evolution of the company through PASSION 2025, ESG matters remain at the forefront of ThaiBev’s transformation plans. This is in line with the clear awakening of the previous years on ESG matters, as Asian companies, in particular, are showing an increase of interest. Specifically, there is also an increasing legal responsibility for the development of climate action plans and recognition of the need to act on ESG matters. ESG is now becoming a risk, legal and financial matter as much as an opportunity. It has shifted from philanthropy to more of the fiduciary responsibility of the company. In other words, ESG trends are here to stay, and their impacts are widely extended to all markets, including Food and Beverage Industry.

From an international perspective like WBCSD, identified ESG trends in the global Food and Beverage industry include supply chain transparency, land management, and water management. We can see an increase in regulations on materials sourcing, as well as issues linked to land use and deforestation. Land management in the new version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol is now encompassing soil health and topics such as nitrogen overuse. Water management is also a significant trend, as the increased frequency of extreme weather events will impact Southeast Asia the most due to its heavy reliance on agriculture. Other trends now being considered include regenerative agriculture, packaging, and health.

With issues identified, one of the urgent actions needed for a global Food and Beverage company is to engage with stakeholders and collaborate along the value chain. Just by looking at the responsibility within one’s internal operation is no longer sufficient, and a single company can no longer bring about solutions. In addition, expectations on how corporate should disclose their ESG impacts are increasing. Investors are now looking at TCFD performance as mandatory disclosure, measuring whether companies can quantify their ESG performance as those that look at resilience have fared better during the pandemic.

It is essential for ThaiBev to take a leadership role on emerging ESG trends and be transparent while demonstrating good practice that is scalable. This means working on projects that influence the core of the business. Being consistent in disclosure and using a consistent methodology to track and disclose ESG performance is also crucial. By taking a leadership role and having credibility, it will be easier to set standards and good practices for smaller companies.

Thailand has recently announced ambitious targets to achieve the intensive Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) at 40% by 2030, carbon neutrality by 2050, and Net Zero Greenhouse Gas Emission by 2065. This supports the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), accelerating trends in circular economy, low carbon economy, and other sustainability topics, specifically the national agenda on Bio-Circular-Green Economic Model (BCG). Plastic reduction and recycling are essential, as Thailand is a major polluter of marine plastic debris. Thai companies are preparing to cope with changing trends through renewable energy, sustainable packaging, supply chain management, and certifications to ensure business continuity and resilience.

Food and Beverage (F&B) companies should focus on packaging and food waste. National legislation may change, especially regarding recycling materials in packaging and the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).

ThaiBev should look at sustainability and circularity holistically, improving initiatives across the value chain. By setting ambitious targets and developing innovative solutions, ThaiBev can lead by example, transforming the supply chain and engaging stakeholders. Initiatives should be actionable and consistent to make a significant impact.

The Ministry of Public Health predicted periodic emerging diseases. The Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Center was set up for diseases like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The COVID-19 situation in Thailand has improved due to government policies and vaccination, building herd immunity.

In 2021, Chulalongkorn Hospital collaborated with the private sector, including ThaiBev, to combat COVID-19, setting up a vaccination center at Samyan Mitrtown. This collaboration combined public health knowledge with private sector strengths, improving patient care.

In the future, as COVID-19 becomes endemic, preventing other diseases from becoming pandemics is crucial. Environmental issues like climate change affect new pandemics. Public awareness, health innovations, and shared knowledge are essential. This knowledge should be global, with initiatives like Schools of Global Health, allowing everyone to learn about public health and apply it in daily life.

# Stakeholder Engagement

ThaiBev has created guidelines for appropriate stakeholder engagement that emphasize the promotion of creative engagement through various activities and communication channels. Demands, opinions, concerns, and suggestions may be voiced through these channels. For each stakeholder group, the frequency of communication varies by operation. The feedback is useful in determining the strategy, direction, plans, and guidelines for future business sustainability development and for the prevention of risks or impacts from business operations.

## Assessment of Key Sustainability Issues

ThaiBev continued to review key sustainability issues by considering global trends and changes with regards to sustainability in the food and beverage industry, issues with international sustainability standards, and challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. ThaiBev performs these types of sustainability assessments every three years and reviews them annually through the following processes:

1. **Identification of Issues**
   - ThaiBev organizes workshops for executives and experts from various business units to examine and determine which sustainability issues are most relevant to business operations. This involves analyzing global trends and changes in sustainability issues, and identifying stakeholder groups and corporate sustainability issues.

2. **Issue Prioritization**
   - ThaiBev prioritizes sustainability issues through two primary activities:
     1. Workshops for senior ThaiBev executives to consider and assess the impacts of sustainability issues on the organization by considering them across three aspects: finance, operations, and reputation.
     2. In-depth interviews with domestic and international representatives from eight stakeholder groups to understand their significance and potential impacts. These two activities were used to better understand sustainability issues facing the organization. Issues ranked as very important by ThaiBev and its stakeholders were considered material sustainability issues.

3. **Validation**
   - The Sustainability Development Working Team (SDWT) reviews and presents material sustainability issues to the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee (CSDC) and the Executive Committee for approval.

4. **Reporting Boundary**
   - To effectively address material sustainability issues, ThaiBev determines the reporting boundary of all 17 material sustainability issues based on information collected from various agencies and relevant stakeholder groups.

5. **Continuous Development**
   - ThaiBev operates under a sustainable development framework through an annual review of sustainability issues, taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives, and also through in-depth interviews. Material sustainability issues help to guide the company’s business operations.

# ThaiBev Material Sustainability Issue

ThaiBev continued to review key sustainability issues facing the organization and added one material issue to the original list of 16 in 2019 to 17 issues in 2020 in response to global trends and stakeholder concerns.

The COVID-19 pandemic required continued government involvement to address the problem, including home quarantine and physical distancing requirements. These impacted people's daily lives and consumption behaviors as they adapted to "new normal" lifestyles. For example, there has been a continued rise in online shopping, as consumers remain concerned about their health and safety.

An assessment of key sustainability issues determined that stakeholders are concerned about the safety of both products and services, as well as employees' safety in the workplace. Supply chain disruptions have further impacted key sustainability issues with important implications. Major issues include:

- Consumer health and safety
- Sustainable supply chain
- Product health and nutrition

# Corporate Governance and Business Ethics

ThaiBev strictly adheres to its Code of Business Conduct while maintaining an efficient management system that is both transparent and verifiable. The company conducts business with integrity, responsibility, and fairness in order to provide all shareholders and stakeholders with utmost confidence. ThaiBev’s business practices have helped it gain a competitive advantage internationally and yielded long-term positive impacts. In everything the company does, it aims to satisfy expectations from the business sector, shareholders, capital markets, and society as a whole.

# Corporate Governance

ThaiBev is committed to compliance while embracing principles of good corporate governance in accordance with its Code of Business Conduct. The company aims to excel in its sustainability and risk management efforts, which are in line with sustainability development guidelines. It seeks to adequately disclose information to build confidence among shareholders, investors, employees, customers, and all other stakeholders. ThaiBev is dedicated to meeting all of its customers' needs, and also to providing internal and external shareholders with stable, sustainable, value-added growth over the long term.

The company's Board of Directors is responsible for organizational leadership, setting up the direction, strategy, and operational objectives for the long-term success of ThaiBev companies. The leadership team seeks to ensure that ThaiBev operates in accordance with the company’s business plan, which is created with input from its shareholders. The business plan also ensures that the company operates in good faith under the law and in line with the company’s rules and regulations. Lastly, it assures that companies in the ThaiBev group and its subsidiaries comply with the regulations of the Singapore Exchange and other related stock exchanges. (For more information on ThaiBev’s organizational structure and corporate governance, view the 2021 annual report here: www.thaibev.com).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore Exchange issued measures enabling listed companies to hold virtual shareholder meetings. For instance, the number of attendees and meeting organizers was limited to a maximum of 50 people. Attendees could submit questions 72 hours prior to the meeting and must comply with social distancing measures. Thus, shareholders were able to receive equal information, and listed companies could lawfully hold meetings. On 21 June 2021, ThaiBev organized its Virtual Annual Information Meeting between the company and shareholders in Singapore, ensuring that they would receive the same information as shareholders who attended the meeting in Thailand. Attendees were invited to send questions on the business and its operations in advance, so the company’s directors and senior management could answer them during the meeting. ThaiBev also disclosed this information the same day through the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGXNET). In addition, the company held a virtual meeting for its own Board of Directors, sub-committees, and subsidiaries, so its directors and senior management in Thailand could offer their opinions and advice. The meeting was held in compliance with rules and regulations as prescribed by the law.

Lastly, to emphasize its commitment to listening to feedback, ThaiBev initiated a whistleblowing policy for receiving complaints from the company’s directors, executives, and employees. In 2021, no significant conflicts or ethical complaints were submitted.

- The company’s ability to uphold its responsibility to society and stakeholders
- Employees’ work efficiency
- Fairness within the organization
- Employee’s dignity and integrity

- Employees’ well-being.

# Anti-Corruption

Corruption is a criminal offense that affects free competition and breaches the company's Code of Business Conduct. It results in damage to the company's reputation, loss of stakeholders' confidence, and impacts the company's profits.

ThaiBev operates its business transparently, morally, and adheres to the principles of fairness and in compliance with the Code of Business Conduct while striving to provide maximum values for stakeholders in Thailand and abroad. ThaiBev's anti-corruption policy establishes practices to protect against corruption and serve as a guideline for business to create a stable and sustainable future.

In the case of changes to the business, regulations, standards, and the law, the President and CEO is responsible for monitoring and implementing an efficient anti-corruption system, reporting to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and reviewing and revising policies to ensure they are up-to-date and responsive to any changes.

Violating the anti-corruption policy can cause severe damage to the company's reputation. If corruption is discovered, it should be reported to the employee's line manager. Any person found to violate the policy will be disciplined in accordance to ThaiBev's rules and prosecuted under the law.

# Adapting to Regulatory Changes

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of compliance with rules and regulations to reduce the risk of being fined or having its licenses revoked, which would impact its business. In 2020, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Thai government implemented measures to protect and contain the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand. Some of the government’s regulations affected ThaiBev and led the company to adjust its business practices. Additionally, the company has a law firm who constantly monitors changes in laws and regulations in Thailand. ThaiBev has various channels to monitor changes in laws and regulations in Thailand, for instance, being a member of The Thai Chamber of Commerce, The Board of Trade of Thailand and The Federation of Thai Industries. Moreover, ThaiBev regularly reviews government websites such as those of The Secretariat of the Prime Minister, The Secretariat of the Cabinet, The Secretariat of the House of Representative, The Royal Gazette, The Office of the Council of State, etc. Consequently, in 2020, ThaiBev adjusted its policies as follows:

- Emergency situation was declared nationwide. Section 9 of Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situation B.E. 2548 and governors’ declaration and commands based on Communicable Disease Act B.E. 2558 regulated the following measures:
  - Closure of COVID-19 at risk public venues such as entertainment venues, service providing venues, live-entertainment venues, massage parlors, and any venues that perform similar services.
  - Prohibition of dine-in customers at restaurants.
  - Closure of shopping malls with restricted opening for essential products.
  - Closure of shops or establishments that hold Type 1 and 2 Alcohol License. ThaiBev was directly impacted given that ThaiBev holds Type 1 Alcohol License.
  - Designated hours in which people are prohibited from leaving their residences, except in necessary and exceptional cases.
  - Prohibition of cross-province transportation at certain hours.

Given the above government orders, ThaiBev had to adjust its production, sales, and distribution plans in accordance to product shelf life and financial liquidity while being able to meet customers’ and consumers’ needs and ensuring business continuity. The plan also included ensuring employee safety in work environment as some employees had to work in the offices while others worked from home following the government order. To ensure employee well-being, ThaiBev distributed alcohol gel, masks, and other essential items to employees.

- Emergency Decree on Electronic Meetings B.E. 2563

In the past, an electronic meeting must follow Announcement No. 74/2557 of the National Council of Peace and Order on electronic meetings, which was signed on 27 June 2014. It specified that one third of attendees must be in the same venue, and all attendees must be in Thailand during the

The company recognizes the importance of extended producer responsibility (EPR). Thus, ThaiBev conscientiously considers the whole life cycle of packaging, from the selection of environmentally friendly materials to easily processed, stored, and recycled product design all the way to product disposal. ThaiBev is committed to the sustainable use of resources to achieve Article 12 of the UN SDGs, which has to do with responsible consumption and production. Furthermore, ThaiBev supports the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) in research and development to accumulate knowledge about packaging for environmental sustainability. These research studies include packaging material flow analysis and value chain analysis. The company also engages in campaigns and public relations initiatives to raise awareness about separating waste for all sectors. ThaiBev promotes the principles of the “3Rs” through training, seminars, and knowledge exchange platforms amongst packaging and product manufacturers, importers, distributors, collectors, and reducers in the beverage industry, as well as the government, education, and civil society sectors. This initiative is meant to reduce environmental impact and help better manage packaging waste in Thailand.

## The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI)

- ThaiBev supports the operations of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) every year, including sponsoring various events, supporting membership fees, and giving research grants related to packaging management.

Furthermore, ThaiBev also attended a meeting with the Ministry of Industry to discuss the shortage of products during COVID-19. ThaiBev confirms that there is no shortage of products; there is a sufficient amount for public consumption. The company also donated 10 refrigerators to hospitals for storing COVID-19 vaccines so that Thais can have access to quality vaccines.

ThaiBev attends meetings to discuss and exchange ideas between the private and public sectors, promoting trade and investment opportunities for both Thai and UK entrepreneurs, increasing business competitiveness in both countries. ThaiBev divides its operations through two taskforces: 1) Trade and investment promotion, and 2) Trade policy review, so that people understand international trade regulations. These two taskforces help drive proposals that are beneficial to both countries. Previously, TUBLC has participated in ministerial-level discussions, meeting with government representatives, the private sector, and academic departments. It has also promoted understanding of trade and investment through social media to the public. ThaiBev believes that these initiatives will help the country cope with the challenges such as free trade negotiations between countries as well as promote new innovations and adaptations necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Topics covered in this event includes technology, innovation, marketing, personnel management, the environment, and unexpected circumstances such as pandemics that affect the business sector.

# UN Global Compact and Global Compact Network Thailand

- In recognizing the importance of sustainable development amongst the private sector, ThaiBev joined the UN Global Compact (UNGC) on July 24, 2019. UNGC is the United Nations’ framework for sustainable development cooperation. It aims to strengthen cooperation amongst companies of all industry sectors, foundations, and non-profit organizations and encourage all parties to be mindful of sustainability in their operations in line with UNGC’s 10 global principles.

ThaiBev recognizes that the protection and conservation of natural resources and the environment are key to sustainable development. Therefore, it is committed to operating in accordance with circular economy principles. It is also dedicated to continual development for more efficient and environmentally friendly applications in energy, water, packaging materials, and waste.

# ThaiBev on COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has upended traditional business models and accelerated the dominance of e-commerce. The pandemic has also impacted how people buy food and beverages in particular, with attention increasingly paid to the source of the products and their labels and nutritional benefits. The availability of effective COVID-19 vaccines is another key driver of business trends.

ThaiBev has always adhered to stringent health and nutritional policies, with a focus on the occupational health and safety of its employees, business partners, and customers. The company recognizes the importance of health and safety for all stakeholders in the organization. Despite the pandemic’s many negative impacts, various new business opportunities have also emerged, such as the development of new technology, innovation, logistics improvements, and the creation of better health and safety practices.

# ThaiBev Strategy Addresses COVID-19 Challenges

To increase stakeholders’ confidence in ThaiBev, the company implemented a business continuity plan in a timely manner, allowing its operations to move forward with minimal impact on employees and other stakeholders. In particular, the ThaiBev Situation Room (TSR) was created with the objective to:

- Monitor and survey the COVID-19 outbreak to formulate policy frameworks and actionable approaches with Human Capital.

- Collect, monitor, and analyze business performance information across ThaiBev’s value chain.

- Collect, analyze and present relevant social news from the public and private sectors that may impact ThaiBev.

In addition, ThaiBev launched numerous preventive measures to ensure the safety and well-being of its employees, customers, and business partners. These measures included the following aspects:

1. Prevent the spread of COVID-19 among all ThaiBev stakeholders.

2. Facilitate the care and treatment of employees infected with COVID-19.

3. Collaborate with other stakeholders to promote public health and wellbeing.

![Images of ThaiBev's COVID-19 preventive measures]

# Management Approach

Management has undertaken efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among employees. To reduce the risk of widespread infection, employees have been categorized into three groups:

1. **Group 1** - Employees who need to work on site
2. **Group 2** - Employees who need to work in teams but are able to work in alternative spaces
3. **Group 3** - Employees who are able to work independently and efficiently from home

ThaiBev has implemented effective prevention and safety measures to respond to and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as follows:

1. As a primary safety measure, the company distributed surgical masks and alcohol to all employees, including those who work from home, ensuring that everyone had sufficient protective equipment for personal use and work-related activities.

2. On a daily basis, all employees, regardless of working location, were required to check-in and perform a COVID-19 self-assessment on the company’s digital platform and mobile application called Beeverest Life. Around 98% of ThaiBev employees, or more than 43,000 persons, use the application.

3. The company has formalized processes for 100% of employees and business partners in high-risk areas to be tested for COVID-19 (by RT-PCR or antigen test kit, ATK).

4. Through an internal communication channel, ThaiBev encourages all of its employees to get vaccinated and educates them on vaccinations. The company also shares guidelines for self-care during the pandemic.

5. A COVID-19 prevention manual was developed to promote good hygiene and safety at ThaiBev production facilities, including for operational staff members, offices, points of sales, and every restaurant in the country. All employees must strictly adhere to the manual.

# Care and Treatment of Employees Infected by COVID-19

ThaiBev utilizes Beeverest Life, a corporate mobile application, to track and monitor employees’ health and well-being during the crisis. Employees are required to take COVID-19 assessments on a daily basis and complete digital check-in three times a day (in the morning, in the afternoon, and at the end of the workday). This enables the company to identify the employees who live and/or work in the maximum and strictly controlled provinces (dark red zones) where there is high-risk exposure to COVID-19 infection. Employees identified as high-risk group are closely monitored in order to provide immediate care and treatment if needed. In addition, ThaiBev has arranged for direct-to-home delivery of surgical masks and 72% alcohol to over 43,000 employees nationwide as preventive and relief measures.

ThaiBev established a COVID-19 Relief Center (CRC), which provides a 24-7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) service to help facilitate care for employees infected by COVID-19, and has partnered with more than 10 hospitals and hospitels to accommodate patients requiring more intensive care. Non-severe cases of COVID-19 go through a home isolation process or are transported to designated isolation centers. They are also provided with COVID-19 care packages that are personally tailored to their needs and symptoms.

COVID-19 also accelerates the adoption of digitalization during the quarantine period where employees are required to work remotely. ThaiBev communicates instructive guidance to ensure that employees have improved digital literacy level and to help them to transition into the new way of work seamlessly and effectively, for instance, IT security, digital lifestyle tips and tricks.

# ThaiBev's Other Stakeholder Welfare Measures

- ThaiBev collaborates with other stakeholders including the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the Thai Chamber of Commerce, private sector business partners and hospitals to promote public health and social well-being. ThaiBev has supported the establishment of out-of-hospital COVID-19 vaccination centers.

- Amidst the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, ThaiBev built Prolab Vibhavadi Medical Technology Clinic (COVID-19 Screening Center) to perform COVID-19 screening and medical analysis via RT-PCR test.

- Built its own surgical mask (including N95) and alcohol wipe production facilities to ensure adequate supply of personal protective equipment for its employees, communities, as well as health care workforce.

- Performed routine cleaning to ensure employee health and safety by spraying disinfectant solutions in work areas and office spaces.

- Provided COVID-19 insurance to 274,000 medical professionals nationwide and more than 50,000 employees and business partners.

- Reduced payment for the social security fund for both employers and employees for three months without impacting the social benefits that employees would receive, in accordance with government resolutions.

# Business Partner Risk Assessment

ThaiBev works closely with its suppliers to assess preparedness for any potential crisis or disruption in the supply chain, such as factory lockdowns, logistics blockages, etc. The assessment focuses on critical suppliers and suppliers of critical materials located in extremely-high risk area in Thailand where there are high numbers of COVID-19 cases. The company coordinates with those suppliers to manage business continuity (i.e. to maintain sufficient inventory levels of key raw materials, establish plans to supply from alternative locations, etc). 100% of critical suppliers and suppliers of critical materials located in extremely high-risk areas are reviewed weekly. Additionally, ThaiBev encourages suppliers to have preventive measures in place to protect their own employees.

## Strengthen Business Resilience During COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted business. To strengthen business resilience and ensure business continuity, ThaiBev has extended its efforts through multiple channels. For instance, OISHI Group launched a promotion to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by implementing an online food ordering system with fewer contact points for consumers. As COVID-19 limited consumers' ability to dine-in at restaurants, the food delivery market has grown exponentially over the past two years. ThaiBev saw the opportunity and launched an online ordering platform called Shopteenee (https://www.shopteenee.com) so consumers can conveniently order products from ThaiBev's brands and restaurants via a single platform. During the lockdown period, restaurants in shopping malls were not allowed to open. OISHI and KFC in response launched a food truck business. KFC has also focused on opening stand-alone/drive-thru shops rather than shops inside shopping malls. The first "OISHI Food Truck" was launched in December 2020 with a popular Japanese menu, focusing on affordable takeout dishes. The food trucks moved around, appearing at different locations, offering convenient, fast, and easily accessible dining options.

Additional measures have also been implemented in restaurants to safeguard both consumers and employees, strictly adhering to the Public Health Ministry guidelines. To respond to the government measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, the dine-in service areas were reduced by 50-60%. QR codes have been utilized in place of book menus in which customers order from their mobile phones to reduce contact in food ordering process.

## Contribution to Public Health & Wellbeing

ThaiBev has collaborated with multiple stakeholders in the public and private sectors to promote health and wellbeing. In order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, ThaiBev supported the establishment of out-of-hospital COVID-19 vaccination service centers.

To help fight the spread of COVID-19, ThaiBev also donated more than 1.4 million liters of alcohol cleaning products, more than 9.3 million surgical masks and more than 240,000 N95 masks, in addition to providing COVID-19 insurance policies to healthcare workers nationwide.

# With PASSION 2025 Commitment

With all of these measures in place and coordination between the corporate level and key stakeholder groups, ThaiBev was able to ensure employee safety through a warning system that alerted people to avoid at-risk areas throughout the country. This underscored a core ThaiBev business strategy in "PASSION 2025."

# Achievements

- **98%** of employees completed daily digital check-ins and COVID-19 assessment via the Beverest Life application
- **1.4 million liters** of 72% alcohol and more than **9 million masks** were distributed
- **57.18 million THB** invested to support the establishment of **4 vaccination centers**
- **>230,000 doses** of vaccine given at the **2 out-of-hospital COVID-19 vaccination centers** supported by ThaiBev

ThaiBev’s actions have reached **>1,500 vaccination centers and medical organizations** and **>5,600 business partners**. This includes the provision of medical supplies and vaccination services to the frontline public servants and healthcare workers, e.g., medical professionals, public health volunteers, and academic personnel. These groups play an essential role in protecting the health and well-being of the communities and ensuring the continuity of civil duties and services for the public.

# Supply Chain Management

The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the way companies think about supply chains, with the focus shifting from efficiency to resiliency. The global supply chain has been upended by regulatory changes and operational uncertainties amid the coronavirus outbreak. Companies need to closely coordinate with their suppliers to adapt to these changes in order to experience minimal negative impact. An increase in resiliency is expected to yield benefits not only during the pandemic but afterward in the form of broader operational sustainability.

To ensure that all products and services are sourced using standardized and environmentally and socially responsible procurement processes throughout the value chain, ThaiBev strongly values collaboration with its suppliers. The company enforces sustainable sourcing policies and upholds the highest procurement standards, while pursuing high-quality service in delivery, in addition to supplier assessment processes and supplier engagement activities. ThaiBev has developed strategies and systems to manage its supply chain and ensure business continuity, and to avoid negative economic, social and environmental impacts, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev strictly follows best practices on supply chain management, including:

1. **Enforcement of the ThaiBev Supplier Code of Practice** with 100% of suppliers. Also, the implementation of a sustainable sourcing policy to ensure that 100% of key agricultural raw materials are responsibly sourced.

2. **Identify critical suppliers and critical materials** to establish risk mitigation plans and supplier relationship management plans.

3. **Implement ESG risk management measures** based on suppliers’ criticality. These include: 
   - Onsite audits by either internal or external auditors.
   - Online assessments via Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM).
   - Third-party risk databases via CROSS Supplier Risk Management (SRM), an online supplier risk assessment and monitoring solution.

4. **Establish supplier performance reviews** and ongoing monitoring processes to identify areas for improvement and develop supplier development plans.

5. **Recognize suppliers with outstanding performance** through the annual Business Partner Award Program to promote suppliers’ competitiveness.

This year, ThaiBev strengthened its commitment to the development of its supply chain, focusing on capacity building and the sharing of best practices in sustainability.

# 2021 Highlight

## ThaiBev’s Supplier Digitalization Journey Towards Sustainability

ThaiBev has implemented an integrated digital procurement solution to enhance overall procurement capability, efficiency, and transparency. It covers end-to-end procurement processes from supplier registration, supplier qualification, bidding and award, documentation (purchase order issuance and invoicing), and supplier evaluation. The solution comprises:

1. **Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM):** 
   - The solution serves as a gateway for new suppliers to register as ThaiBev Group’s suppliers.
   - It is a mandatory requirement for all suppliers to accept and agree to comply with ThaiBev Supplier Code of Practice, verify their identity, and undertake a sustainability assessment survey before being able to register.

2. **CROSS Procurement:**
   - CROSS Procurement solution is a digital procurement system invented to improve the efficiency of sourcing processes.
   - The solution is seamlessly connected with SLCM and plays a role in fulfilling the procurement processes.
   - It instantly records the purchase of products and services that take place throughout ThaiBev’s operations. This ensures that procurement is fair, transparent, and traceable.
   - The key features include CROSS Supplier Risk Management (SRM), CROSS Source, CROSS Contract, CROSS Buy, CROSS Purchase Order (PO), CROSS Invoice, and CROSS Analytics.

### SLCM Diagram

ThaiBev’s digital procurement landscape increases supply chain visibility and raises the standard of procurement by fostering stakeholder collaboration, process re-engineering, and online connectivity. These benefits give ThaiBev advantages in decision making and sourcing strategizing, in turn enabling effective and real-time risk management.

ThaiBev is mindful of supplier’s information security and the potential damages from any leaks or misuse of supplier’s data. ThaiBev applies corporate cyber risk management and information security protocols to supplier’s information security management as well to ensure that supplier’s data are properly managed and securely protected.

In addition to this enhancement, in 2021 ThaiBev in collaboration with the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) has launched TSCN Platform (thailandsupplychain.com), a premium online business community which connects all qualified business partners across diverse industries altogether in one consolidated platform. It is powered by artificial intelligence (AI), creating more business opportunities for the platform members through demand and supply matching suggestions. It also serves as a shared knowledge center for sustainable business practices which is publicly accessible.

High-performing suppliers are able to register on the platform and receive accreditation from other members via the platform’s Endorsement System in order to promote business and increase the opportunities to get business matching.

## TSCN Platform Benefits

- **More business opportunities for TSCN members from AI suggestion in business matching**

ThaiBev’s strategic business partners, i.e., critical suppliers, suppliers with strong business relationships, suppliers with high volume and transactions, were given privilege to be the pilot TSCN Platform members in August 2021. In addition, ThaiBev and TSCN plan on expanding the TSCN Platform to the wider group of private companies, including SMEs, to boost the local economy as well as support smaller local entrepreneurs.

## Pilot Launch Results

- **87%** of pilot members would recommend the TSCN Platform to their own suppliers.

# Key Projects

## Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) 2021

ThaiBev collaborated with sustainability leading organizations, i.e., PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited and Thai Union Group Public Company Limited, along with Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) members to organize Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) 2021 as a virtual expo which received a lot of online attention and good feedback throughout its 11 days during 30 September – 10 October 2021. ThaiBev alongside with 25 business partners from both private and government sectors organized “Partnerships for the Goals” online exhibition as part of TSX 2021 which features sustainability leading practices from various industries, publicly accessible to all business partners and to the public. The main objective is to emphasize the need for business partners to adopt and integrate sustainability into their business and at the same time provide opportunities to the business partners who are committed to operating their business sustainably to promote and showcase their businesses. The exhibition is still open online for public access on TSX official website (tsx2021.thailandsustainabilityexpo.com).

Other notable activities at TSX 2021 for ThaiBev’s business partners are TSCN Platform online exhibition which officially introduces TSCN Platform, including its key functions and benefits to all business partners for the first time and ThaiBev Business Partner Award 2021 Announcement via a live video streaming during the Commitment Day on 10 October 2021 to recognize the business partners who have outstanding performances in both commercial and sustainability aspects publicly.

It also ensured they were aligned with ThaiBev’s sustainability development framework, unlocking business potential for all suppliers. Looking forward, ThaiBev is transforming its procurement to a global shared service, complying with a harmonized group-wide procurement policy and operating model in order to drive benefits through compliance and individual adherence. The procurement transformation involves five key areas: people, organization, process, policy, and technology.

# Achievements

## Collaboration for a Sustainable Supply Chain

- ThaiBev selects quality raw materials for its alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, and food production through a socially and environmentally responsible procurement process in line with top global standards, such as Bonsucro, SEDEX, RSPO, SAI Platform, UTZ, etc. Examples of ThaiBev’s key agricultural raw materials include malt, sugar, broken rice, palm oil, and tea leaves. ThaiBev has established sourcing requirements to procure these key raw materials from qualified suppliers operating in accordance with the aforementioned standards. The requirements are included in the following procurement processes: supplier qualification, bidding submission, and supplier evaluation.

- ThaiBev committed to working with suppliers, including farmers, to initiate programs to mitigate the impacts from climate change and natural disasters that affect the quantity and price of their raw agricultural materials, as well as the farmers’ incomes and general wellbeing.

## Business Resilience and Risk Management

- ThaiBev considers sustainability factors in all aspects of its procurement process and requires suppliers to comply with the Supplier Code of Practice and undergo strict supplier screening which includes environmental, social, and governance criteria and quality assurance processes. This applies to 100% of ThaiBev’s suppliers. ThaiBev also makes sustainability a criterion in supplier qualification, bidding, and supplier performance evaluation.

- ThaiBev has formalized processes to identify its critical suppliers annually in order to develop supplier relationship management strategies, together with the prioritization of resources and supplier risk management. Factors to define critical suppliers include the level of the supplier’s sustainability maturity, the supplier’s business goals (and its alignment with ThaiBev’s goals), suppliers that provide critical materials, suppliers that are non-substitutable, and the interdependency between ThaiBev and the supplier. This enables ThaiBev to identify and mitigate potential risks in the procurement process throughout the supply chain.

## Capacity Development for Local Suppliers

- In 2021, 97% of ThaiBev’s procurement came from local suppliers, following its policy to encourage sourcing from nearby business operations for sustainability and economic reasons. ThaiBev aims to reduce environmental impacts by optimizing transportation distances and fuel consumption, and limiting pollution. This also helps boost income distribution and job creation among SME suppliers and in the surrounding communities.

- ThaiBev builds local suppliers’ capacity through the Business Partner Award, the sharing of sustainability-related information, and engagement in various sustainability projects. This allows ThaiBev to gain more sourcing alternatives and mitigate risks from limited raw materials. This includes risks in the importation of raw materials and services, including delays in transportation and the disruption of business operations.

## 2021 Performance & Progress

1. 100% of active suppliers must accept and comply with ThaiBev’s Supplier Code of Practice.
2. 97% of ThaiBev procurement is locally based.
3. 100% of new suppliers undertake a sustainability risk assessment.
4. 100% of critical suppliers are audited on-site.
5. 100% of key agricultural raw materials are responsibly sourced.

# COVID-19 Response

## Collaborating with Our Suppliers to Manage Business Continuity Risks in the Supply Chain

ThaiBev has carefully monitored the COVID-19 crisis from the beginning to make sure it can properly handle the situation and its impacts on business. ThaiBev works closely with its suppliers to assess preparedness for any crises or potential disruptions in the supply chain, such as factory lockdowns, logistics blockages, and others.

ThaiBev pays attention to critical suppliers and suppliers of critical materials that operate in extremely high-risk areas (dark red zones), meaning those in locations most exposed to COVID-19, with high numbers of cases. The company coordinates with those suppliers to manage business continuity (e.g., maintain sufficient inventory levels of key raw materials, establish plans to supply from alternative locations, etc.). Additionally, ThaiBev requires suppliers to implement preventive measures to protect their own employees’ health and safety.

# Risk Management

Businesses today face many challenges to their sustainability and growth. The COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and new technology threats and vulnerabilities are all posing unique challenges. The global food and beverage industry has faced significant disruptions in its supply chain, alongside rapid changes in consumer behaviour and demand in recent years. Although at-home consumption sales have significantly increased as a result, out-of-home consumption is stagnant, leading food and beverage businesses to implement new risk assessment and risk management strategies to make operations in a VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) world more resilient.

ThaiBev works diligently to manage risks through its sustainability strategy, which enables it to explore opportunities, prevent and mitigate impacts, respond efficiently to challenges, and take full advantage of execution to achieve its goal of becoming the stable and sustainable ASEAN leader in beverage and food business.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev’s risk management strategy focuses on monitoring global trends, potential rules and regulations, and peers’ actions, evaluating ESG topics, and managing uncertainties throughout the value chain through the integration of the concept of sustainability risk into the company’s “Enterprise Risk Management Framework.”

ThaiBev’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework, which is aligned with the COSO: Enterprise Risk Management Framework, has been implemented with the following key components:

1. **Governance Structure**
   - ThaiBev’s risk governance structure starts from the Board of Directors, a range of committees, to product groups and business units, covering all inputs and advice from the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (“SRMC”). The SRMC acts as a main communication point where all identified sustainability-related risks, impacts and opportunities are gathered for further company-wide sustainability and risk assessment and management.

2. **Understanding of Business Context and Sustainability Strategies**
   - ThaiBev seeks to conduct its business with a focus on sustainable development, with all functions aligned. It aims to achieve this by analyzing and monitoring risk factors, ESG related risks and significant future trends that may affect business operations or corporate strategies such as impacts on the company’s sustainability investing.

3. **Holistic Risk Management Process**
   - ThaiBev embraces a holistic risk management process from the corporate level down to operations by collecting information, identifying and assessing key risks, and establishing strategies and systematic approaches for managing risks, including by creating new business opportunities in line with ThaiBev’s strategies and sustainability objectives.

4. **Communication, Reporting, and Evaluation**
   - ThaiBev emphasizes communication, reporting, and evaluation of risk and sustainability impacts and management success at all levels, from departments, subsidiary entities, business units, and product groups to the corporate level, in a clear and continuous manner. It monitors the progress of sustainability projects and risk management activities, highlighting any potential risks that may impact ThaiBev and its stakeholders.

5. **Sustainability and Risk Management Culture**
   - ThaiBev promotes sustainability and a risk management culture through continually updating potential risks, training and arranging other engagement activities for executives and employees at all levels. The aim is to create awareness of the importance of sustainability and risk management to encourage engagement in these areas. In addition, executives, and line managers’ performance assessments and financial incentives, such as compensation and bonuses, are linked to sustainability and/or risk management KPIs and are also aligned with the ThaiBev PASSION 2025 business strategy.

# Insights

ThaiBev has been committed to sustainability across its entire business under the mission of "Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth" with its stakeholders. The company has adopted sustainability strategies, principles, and approaches by integrating into decisions and operations in terms of ESG: Environmental, Social, and Governance to ensure resilience and long-term value creation. On the considerations of the SRMC, sustainability risks associated with uncertain social or environmental events or conditions are strongly focused on the development and potential emergence because if they occur, they can cause significant negative impact on the company. Although changing social or environmental factors are the challenges to be addressed, they may bring opportunities to the company which we need to be ready to capture the arising opportunities to achieve the goal of becoming ASEAN beverage industry leader. At ThaiBev, sustainability risk management is therefore a key business process that aligns sustainability with risk management by using the principles of enterprise-wide risk management to support the company’s sustainability goals. In 2021, the SRMC has considered significant ESG risks posed to the company, i.e., water-related risk, climate change, change in consumer behavior; and closely monitored the mitigation actions and adaptation to ensure business resilience.

# Achievements

## Risk Assessment to Risk Management Strategy

Under rapidly changing business environment, ThaiBev performs an annual review of its identified risks under three categories: Strategic, ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) and Operational, all of which are linked to key sustainability issues in 3 dimensions: environment, social, and economic. The annual risk review and assessment enables the company to formalize effective corporate risk management strategies and approaches.

In 2021, despite the risks and challenges that were heavily centered around COVID-19, ThaiBev incorporated external and internal factors, global impacts of COVID-19, sustainability risks, global trends after the COVID-19 pandemic, expectations among stakeholders and ThaiBev business goals into the risk analysis and assessment process. The outcome of risk review and assessment indicates the risks with higher risk level and emerging risks that pose challenges and require the company to pay close attention, adopt effective mitigations, including adapt its strategy and/or business model. For the risks with unchanged risk level, ThaiBev will continue to monitor and analyze changes in risk level periodically, and maintain pre-COVID-19 risk mitigation plan.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

ThaiBev's corporate risks from the recent review and assessment can be categorized into three groups as follows:

| Risk Category       | (1) Risk with unchanged risk level                  | (2) Risk with higher risk level                                      |

## Mitigating Key Emerging Risks

ThaiBev has considered the "global infectious diseases" and the "climate change related risks" as key emerging risks in 2021 which are increasingly critical, long-term threats to the organization’s success, sustainability impacts and mitigations, including sustainability investing. The company has anticipated and modelled their impacts on the business in order to effectively respond and build business resilience.

### Responding to Global Infectious Diseases

To mitigate COVID-19’s impact on long-term business performance and growth, ThaiBev transformed its business strategies and invested in digital technology and innovations throughout its value chain. ThaiBev co-founded the Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN) with a network of its supply chain partners in order to manage business continuity risks and ensure resilience across multiple supply chain challenges. The company’s beverage business developed new alcoholic products for at-home consumption, implemented online marketing strategies, and launched a vitamin drink to help strengthen people’s immunity, in addition to other healthy beverages. The food business offered an enhanced online ordering and delivery system by partnering with food aggregators and introduced “Shopteenee.com,” a website and application for online food and beverage delivery in Thailand. This includes introducing new menus/recipes and contactless payment, to allow consumers to enjoy the company’s products safely. A cloud kitchen system was introduced to optimize capacity and increase productivity of the company’s restaurants. These measures have enhanced the company’s product and service offerings. In managing material social risks and opportunities among key stakeholders, such as employees, customers, suppliers, and communities, ThaiBev distributed surgical masks and alcohol sanitizers to employees, hospitals, schools, and impacted communities. To prepare for potential future impacts, the company invested in a COVID-19 testing center for employees, while also offering low-cost COVID-19 testing to the general public. ThaiBev also built alcohol sanitizer, surgical and N95 mask production facilities to supply these products for employees and business partners. In the post-COVID-19 era, ThaiBev will continue to create new opportunities for living sustainably, with a focus on the circular economy and creating a healthier environment, while promoting health and wellness, and increasing growth in the business’s digital and D2C channels.

### Responding to Climate-Related Regulatory or Transition Risk

Climate-related risks can be divided into physical risks and transitions risks. Physical risks include acute risks from extreme weather events (e.g., storms, droughts, floods, and forest fires) and chronic risks from higher longer-term shifts in precipitation and temperature, and increased variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rises). As a leading producer of beverages and foods, ThaiBev could be exposed to significant climate-related risks from upstream agricultural production. A disruption in the supply of raw materials could result in steep price increases and volatility. Water is a key factor of production for ThaiBev, so the company could also potentially be affected by major water-related risks such as

# Risk Management

Floods, droughts, and water pollution, all of which are also interrelated, affect ThaiBev's production sites and surrounding communities. These areas are likely to face extreme weather events, particularly flooding/flash floods, while some factories in high-water stress areas have faced water shortages due to decreasing availability. This contrasts with the current surface water consumption at production sites, which is likely to increase annually due to production and sales volumes. Furthermore, saltwater intrusion into the Chao Phraya River, a major river in Thailand, significantly impacts water quality for ThaiBev's production as well as consumption in communities. In addition to physical climate risks, climate-related risks are also associated with the transition to a lower-carbon global economy. The most common risks relate to policy and legal actions, technological changes, market responses, and reputational considerations. Failure to adjust climate change priorities and reduce carbon emissions in the value chain would affect ThaiBev's operations and financial results. In this regard, ThaiBev has analyzed climate-related financial risks and opportunities in line with TCFD recommendations.

To manage climate-related risks and opportunities, ThaiBev has established climate strategy and climate-related goals and targets. These include a 15% GHG emission reduction, 5% water intensity reduction and transition to renewable energy use to be at least 40% of total energy use annually by 2025. All ThaiBev plants have performed a water sustainability assessment on adequacy and quality, and continued monitoring new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations (i.e., surface water tariffs and carbon taxes), and attitudes among surrounding communities and stakeholders. Effective approaches for water and energy management and consumption in both the short and long term have been determined and implemented. The company will also adopt transition to renewable and clean energy and environmentally friendly production technologies for water, by enhancing energy saving and recycling efforts, for instance with glass bottle washers and rinsers, and through other new technologies. To respond to the physical risks arising from climate change, the company has established natural disaster preparedness plans and storm management plans. ThaiBev has also conducted water stewardship initiatives, energy and climate change management activities, and other forms of engagement, including partnering with internal and external stakeholders from the community level to the national level. To prevent supply-chain disruptions resulting from climate change, ThaiBev focuses on sustainable sourcing and procurement and performs annual climate-related risk assessment of key suppliers. In respect with the potential enforcement of national climate change mitigation legislation particularly laws on public watercourse management, ThaiBev’s 34 production sites in Thailand located in 17 river basins have joined up with other water users in the same basin to register as a water-user body to maintain common interests in area water management in line with the rules and regulations, including the directions and policies determined by the drainage basin committee and the National Water Resources Commission.

## SDG Indicators

By frequently analyzing emerging risks and planning out short-term to medium-term mitigation initiatives, ThaiBev is contributing to following sub-SDGs Goals.

- **12.6** Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle - ThaiBev has collaborated with leading Thai organizations who are role models in sustainability to annually organize Thailand Sustainability Expo which is aimed to share knowledge on sustainability practices and raise awareness of its significance for the society.

- **16.3** Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all – ThaiBev strictly respects human rights and complies with national and international laws by implementing approaches for human rights management throughout the value chain. In addition, we have implemented the channels for stakeholders to report suspicious wrongdoings, criminal activities or other unlawful conducts, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements and Business Ethics or Code of Conduct of ThaiBev Group as identified in the whistleblowing policy which has been disseminated and made publicly available on the company’s website.

# Towards 2025 and Beyond

## MID- AND LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS

ThaiBev has established mid- and long-term sustainability targets for environmental, social, and governance risks that we will address to attain sustainability. For instance,

# Information Technology and Cyber Security

In the past, a company’s data was mostly stored on physical computers, and the information technology (IT) department was responsible for overseeing its protection, ensuring that all systems were secure and that information was not leaked to outside parties. Today, even the strongest IT security is not enough to protect an organization. Cybercriminals use new methods to bypass corporate IT systems, including using employees inside an organization to access the company’s data.

As the world increasingly consumes information online, the collection of personal data by company stakeholders needs to be done carefully and always with the consent of those concerned. Furthermore, personal data collection must always comply with the Personal Data Protection Act of 2019.

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of corporate IT protection. Each employee in the organization has a responsibility to support IT security. With this in mind, ThaiBev has launched new initiatives to provide more IT-related support to its employees, business groups, and other related parties. The aim is to ensure that all employees participate in data protection and IT security. This also means not infringing on or violating the rights of data owners, especially those who are stakeholders in the organization.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev has implemented cyber risk management and information security protocols in line with international standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework. These cyber security frameworks include prevention plans, detection, and rapid responses to threats in compliance with global standards. There are 5 main processes, including: IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVERY.

The Board of Directors and executives at ThaiBev contribute to the identification of strategies related to information technology security, together with cyber security and procedures, so they are in line with corporate guidelines and international standards.

Additionally, the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee is also responsible for ensuring that it has addressed information security and cyber security among ThaiBev's potential risks. The ThaiBev Information Technology Committee ensures that the company’s information technology and cyber risks can be managed effectively and that all potential negative impacts on the organization and its business can be mitigated.

## ThaiBev's IT Security Risk Management Structure

| Board of Directors | Audit Committee |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Executive Committee | Sustainability and Risk Management Committee |
| President and CEO | |
| Chief Information and Security Officer (CI&SO) | |
| Information Technology Director | |

## Strategies

- Maximize IT Security Protection by proactively managing Cyber/IT Security risks in all ThaiBev’s systems.
- Prioritize IT Security Risks as one of the most important corporate risks and periodically review IT security issues in the SRMC meeting.
- 100% of employees receive IT Security Protection training.
- Ensure that the Personal Data Protection is executed by all employees and comply with Personal Data Protection Act, B.E. 2562 (2019).

## IT Security Policy

ThaiBev has formulated the IT Security Policy since 2020 to define the direction, principles, and framework of IT/Cyber security management requirements including proactively creating knowledge and understanding for employees to comply with policies, standards, operational framework operating procedures, advice, including laws relating to computer systems correctly and appropriately.

![ISO/IEC 27001 Certification](https://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/iso-27001/resources/ISO-27001-Information-Security-Management-Whitepaper.pdf)

ThaiBev received the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Certification in 2020 and 2021.

# Information Technology and Cyber Security

## IT Security Protection Enhancement Project 2021

Throughout 2021, the IT security team has strengthened the security of the entire IT system of the organization to effectively prevent external intrusion by deriving various important projects, which can be summarized as follows:

### 1. IT Security Awareness

ThaiBev believes that most corporate data breach incidents are caused by employee error and such incidents can be avoided by providing hands-on IT Security training to educate employees and measure their knowledge using an examination for over selected 1,600 employees in 2021, which have received positive feedback. The company will continue this training program to cover the entire ThaiBev employees in 2022.

### 2. Cyber Security Process Improvement

ThaiBev has improved its cyber security processes to be more effective by establishing the Security Operation Center to monitor and detect any threats or any malfunctions of the entire IT system 24 hours. Then, it will send a notification to relevant departments automatically if any risk is detected so that such issues will be resolved quickly and systematically.

### 3. Vulnerability Process Improvement

ThaiBev conducts the vulnerability assessment to identify security weaknesses in networks, systems, and applications from any intruders. Moreover, ThaiBev has received an external IT security verification certificate from Lloyd’s Register International (Thailand) Limited in 2021 to ensure that the assessment is universal and meets world standards.

### 4. Anti-Virus Optimization

Enhanced anti-virus processes provide organizations with full protection from intruders at any point in the network to defeat every attack with automatic alerts at every step of the network.

### 5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

ThaiBev has developed and enabled Two-Factor Authentication on all corporate mails and VPN systems to enhance the security of executives and employees' e-mail systems to protect high-priority organization data by enabling users to perform 2-step verification using passwords in combination with user's mobile verification before gaining access to the company's systems.

- **Water Discharge**

- **Sustainable Communities**

ThaiBev has established corporate water management, environmental, and sustainability policies to minimize the company’s environmental impacts for the benefit of current and future generations. These policies apply to all employees and fall under national and international laws, regulations, and standards, including ISO 14001 and ISO 50001.

Moreover, ThaiBev fully supports the Thai government’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, and the company strives to be Thailand’s industry leader in reducing GHG emissions in order to do its part to combat global climate change.

# Climate Change

ThaiBev has significantly increased its commitment to combat the global climate crisis through measures that are increasing readiness and resilience, expanding mitigation, and supporting the global transition to a low-carbon economy. A detailed Climate Strategy now guides numerous policies and actions across operations. New developments include the reporting of Scope 3 emissions for the first time, the release of ThaiBev’s first Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) compliant report, the launch of a Waste Database, and public pledges on the preservation of biodiversity and forests. Furthering existing efforts, ThaiBev continues to reduce its water footprint through Water Sustainability Assessments (WSA), implement new renewable energy sources at factories, and engage in circular economy practices. The company has also taken an active leadership role within both the business sector and local communities to raise awareness and best practices of a healthier planet.

# Management Approach

## Strategy:

ThaiBev’s Climate Strategy, launched in FY 2020, consists of three pillars. Pillar 1 is dedicated to Climate Change Adaptation, to ensure the company is resilient in the face of ongoing climate change and shifts that will occur in the medium to long term. Pillar 2, Climate Change Mitigation, consists of the company’s efforts to minimize the effects of climate change and ensure a smooth transition to the low carbon economy. Pillar 3, Communities, showcases ThaiBev’s work with communities around production sites and conservation of the environment in surrounding areas.

## Disclosures:

ThaiBev has introduced climate reporting in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in FY 2020 and plans to update annually to ensure transparency with stakeholders. Additionally, climate reporting has been extended to the wider value chain – known as Scope 3 – for the first time. A screening exercise has been performed for all 15 categories and the relevant categories for ThaiBev’s operations have been disclosed this year.

## Assessments and Analyses:

A natural hazards risk assessment performed in 2019 and covering all production sites in Southeast Asia identified potential physical risks for ThaiBev. The analysis used RCP 4.5 as an ambitious emissions reduction scenario, and RCP 8.5 as a business-as-usual scenario, enabling ThaiBev to model and plan appropriately for both optimistic and worst-case climate change scenarios. The results revealed ThaiBev’s exposure to chronic climate impacts such as water scarcity, which could impact ThaiBev’s operation costs by up to 92 million THB annually at a single factory if no action is taken. To avoid impacts from water scarcity such as prolonged factory shutdown, product groups have identified alternative water sources, increased water efficiency per finished goods, and maximized water reuse and recycling initiatives. Acute climate impacts such as storm surge and flooding have also been studied as short to medium term risks and factories have developed management plans to prepare for and minimize impacts. This physical risk assessment will be extended to the value chain in the fiscal year 2022, giving ThaiBev a clear understanding of risks that apply to upstream and downstream activities.

ThaiBev prioritizes transition climate risk through analysis of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). The NDCs scenario reflects the majority of ThaiBev’s operations in Thailand, and a planned surface water tariff has been identified as the most material risk in this scenario. ThaiBev manages this risk by increasing water efficiency and applying the 3Rs to the production process and improving transparency of the water footprint of products through certifications such as Water Footprint of Product. ThaiBev uses the SDS scenario to study the medium to long-term and fully understand the requirements of the low-carbon economic transitions. The SDS reflects a relatively high price of carbon (43 USD) and significant cost to ThaiBev’s operations with the estimated cost ranging between 60-75 million THB for considered emission pathways. The SDS is modeled in three emission trajectories: ThaiBev’s emission reduction targets are achieved, business-as-usual in which emissions continue at the current level, and a worst case in which emissions increase annually.

## 2021 Highlight

### Scope 3 Emissions Assessed:

As ThaiBev works towards the company’s 2025 science-based emission reduction target, the company has screened and disclosed scope 3 emissions for the first time. The scope 3 emissions data have been collected through collaboration with value chain partners to obtain primary data such as purchased goods emission factors, and secondary data in other areas. ThaiBev’s scope 3 emissions assessment reveals key emission reduction opportunities and the impact of initiatives ThaiBev has already implemented. For example, ThaiBev’s long established bottle reuse scheme allowed the company to avoid an estimated 107,871 tCO₂e in FY 2021 by directly reusing bottles, reducing emissions in Category 1 – Purchased Goods and Services.

Due to the travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions related to Category 6 - Business Travel were not collected in 2021. Fuel and Energy Related Activities is currently a large contributor to ThaiBev’s scope 3 emissions, and the company expects to see reductions in the coming years as further solar rooftops and biogas projects are implemented, reducing the well-to-tank emissions associated with purchased fossil fuels. Category 5 - Waste Generated in Operations represent an opportunity for further reductions in scope 3 emissions. ThaiBev will be working with all factories using the company’s recently launched Waste Database to improve the monitoring of waste generated and implement waste reduction hierarchy measures to minimize waste directed to disposal.

# Key Projects

## Biogas Plant Project in Thailand

In 2021, ThaiBev expanded to seven biogas plants, starting operations in Nong Khai and Nakhon Sawan provinces.

Biogas plants use by-products from alcohol distillation, vinasse, as input to produce biogas, a renewable form of energy for generating steam instead of non-renewable fossil fuels. This project was successfully able to produce 332,648,627 Megajoules (MJ) thermal energy from biogas that reduces the consumption of fuel oil by 10.39 million liters per year, an equivalent of 145 million THB. It also successfully reduced annual GHG emissions by 32,585 tCO₂e. In addition, excess biogas from steam production processes can further be used to generate electricity at 8,393 Megawatt hours (MWh) to be sold to local power grids.

## Recycling Energy from Liquid Carbon Dioxide Evaporation into Cooling Systems (waste to energy recovery)

Beer Thip Brewery (1991) Co., Ltd. cooperates with the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), under the Ministry of Energy, to use liquid carbon dioxide evaporation for cooling systems. The beer brewing process uses a coolant called Glycol, which its temperature increases before being transferred back into the cooling system. The evaporation of liquid carbon dioxide releases cool air, which reduces the temperature of glycol. As a result, the plant's cooling system's waste heat is recovered and used elsewhere in the factory.

In 2021, this process is able to reduce energy consumption by 950,717 Megajoules. It also reduces greenhouse gas emissions equal to 158 tCO₂e per year. The investment for this project is approximately 1.7 million THB, with support of 350,000 THB from the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), Ministry of Energy. In total, the project is also able to reduce electricity charges by approximately 1.12 million THB.

## Once Through Boiler

Many spirits, beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and food factories installed once through boilers to increase energy efficiency and reduce the use of non-renewable fuels. The initiative is able to reduce fuel oil usage by 0.41 million liters per year, an equivalent of 8.29 million THB and reduce the use of coal by 4,392 tons per year, an equivalent of 16.37 million THB. Greenhouse gas emissions are also reduced at 11,425 tCO₂e per year.

# Water Stewardship

The world’s water resources are increasingly in crisis. Water shortages, floods, and pollution are affecting livelihoods and the economy on a more regular basis. Recognizing that these problems will continue to have an impact in the short and long term, ThaiBev focused on sustainable water management practices, through assessment tools and innovative projects at the factory and community levels. ThaiBev aims to maximize resource efficiency, maintain clean water standards, and protect important watersheds across the country. Through all these organizational mechanisms, ThaiBev committed to fulfilling its long-term Corporate Water Management Policy, which aims to balance economic, social, and environmental requirements with the long-term protection of water resources.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

Since ThaiBev manufactures beverages, water is a critical resource to its operations and thus important to its risk management as well. The company conducted an analysis of water-related risks that may result from climate change. Climate change affects rainfall, for example, causing uneven and less predictable rainfall, changing the spatial distribution of the rainfall, and even causing a decrease in rain volume. This is an issue of priority for ThaiBev as 42.22% of its factories are located in areas subject to high to very-high water stress, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI)’s Aqueduct Global Water Tool. Additionally, water quality is also at risk, due to the intrusion of seawater into the surface water. To mitigate the impact of these risks, ThaiBev committed to efficient water resource management. The risks associated with operating costs are projected to be approximately 13.5 million THB.

![Factory Image](image-placeholder)

## Management Approach

Water is an essential natural resource for the production process. The demand for water continues to increase but the availability of water is decreasing due to degradation of water resources, water pollution, and the effects of climate change. ThaiBev recognizes the importance of water conservation to maintain high water quality and ensure sufficient quantity for production while minimizing the impact to the communities. Therefore, water management is identified as one of the key risks. A monitoring system is established to closely monitor the quantity and quality of water to mitigate any possible impacts. The water risk assessment conducted by Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas by World Resources Institute (WRI) shows that a number of ThaiBev plants are located in high water stressed areas. Therefore, ThaiBev has collaborated with the private and government sectors to implement necessary measures regarding water usage and conservation practices.

# 2021 Highlight

## Surface Water and Groundwater Sustainability Assessment

ThaiBev regularly conducts a Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA) covering both surface water and groundwater resources at production facilities to identify any potential impact and risks associated with its business units. This in-depth assessment covers four dimensions:

1. **Detailed water source assessment**, including the availability of water sources and the internal structure of water resources.
2. **The vulnerability of the watershed**, considering both social and environmental factors.
3. **Water-related natural occurrences**, such as droughts, floods, etc.
4. **The quality of water sources**.

This assessment covers a period of five years to ensure there are sustainable water supplies to support the facilities’ operations. Processes in the study include:

### Water Sufficiency

- Analyze and create a base map of the production facilities using USGS ASTER GDEM satellite imagery, Google Earth, field site visits, and other relevant maps of micro watersheds within the site’s water source area (within approximately 50-70 kilometers).

- Gather information on drainage areas, major aquifers and water bodies, catchment areas, geology, land use and land cover categories, crop types, and irrigation inventory and identify the source of potential water pollutants.

- Assess surface water sources by obtaining information from government water management agencies which characterize the surface water bodies.

- Collect rainfall data from nearest rain gauge station for the past 10-20 years, including average annual rainfall, intensity of rainfall (maximum and minimum), number of rain days, information on evaporation, and historical events related to rainfall in the past 10-20 years.

- Explore the factories’ locations and details about their water usage. This includes water storage such as raw water ponds, wastewater treatment system, etc.

### Water Quality

- Conduct field surveys in the factory site and surrounding areas. The survey results are documented through written field notes and photographs. The field survey methods are as follows:
  - Visually inspect land use pattern, land use of significant environmental concerns, and physical characteristics.

# Rules and Regulations Related to Water Resources

- **Identify the potential contaminants** associated with potential pollutant sources.
- **Review any risk mitigating factors** at the potential pollutant sources.
- **Inspect the wastewater quality** discharged from each activity of the factory.

## Review Rules and Regulations

- Review rules and regulations related to surface water sources, together with regional and national water policies and regional regulations regarding surface water usage related to industry as well as to the public.
- Review publicly available databases on related laws and regulations in order to identify the environmental concerns of government bodies as related to micro watersheds.

## Stakeholders’ Perception

- Conduct perception surveys of community members surrounding the factories to better understand their perception about water availability and their perception about the water-related impacts of the industry and the way to mitigate such impacts.
- Additional analysis in order to better understand:
  - Broad socio-economic profile of the area
  - History of the community coming together for action
  - Perception towards the presence of the industrial activity and expectations
  - Potential for opposition

ThaiBev employed satellite imagery to study watershed topography, water flow direction, drainage patterns, slope patterns of irrigation canals, rivers, canals, reservoirs, dams, and neighboring areas, together with trends of land usage during the past 10 years. This allowed ThaiBev to create a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy that is appropriate for local conditions while addressing both long-term and short-term risks.

This year, ThaiBev extended the Surface Water and Groundwater Sustainability Assessment to nine more factories covering all business units. In the future, ThaiBev will expand this water assessment to cover all factories in Thailand for its sustainable water management by 2023.

# Organizations of Water Users

In 2021, Thailand’s Office of the National Water Resources (ONWR) organized a collaborative effort called ‘Organizations of Water Users’ which brings together the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors in the name of better management of the country’s water resources. This significant initiative encourages the different sectors to collaborate in solving water-related problems such as floods, droughts, and water-related issues.

ThaiBev was registered as a member of the ‘Organization of Water User’ for 12 water basins out of the 22 water basins across the country. More than 24 factories out of ThaiBev’s 37 factories use surface water, a resource crucial to business operations. The role of the Organizations of Water Users is to execute the proper use, development, and management of water resources and to carry out the maintenance, restoration, and conservation of water resources in their respective water basin areas. The members of these organizations also have the opportunity to be elected as water basin committee members of their respective areas. The members of this committee have the right to be elected as a representative of their water basin committee in the ONWR as well.

To assist this collaborative effort, ThaiBev established a working group at its plant location dedicated to monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on water-related issues. This group is also responsible for collaborating with relevant agencies to develop a water risk review report covering the next five years. Additionally, this group engages with various stakeholders, facilitating community surveys and meetings with community leaders and local authorities to hear their opinions on the plant’s operations and to respond to any water-related concerns. This information is used to formulate short- and long-term water risk management plans and is also reported monthly to the product group risk coordinator. From here, this information is then presented to executives and the Sustainable and Risk Management Committee (SRMC) in charge of enterprise risk management for ThaiBev.

ThaiBev hopes that its active participation in this important new collaboration between various sectors in managing the country’s water resources will help to alleviate the problems related to floods, droughts, and water quality. In addition, the company hopes that increased participation in national water policies will further embed efficient and sustainable water management practices in the country for a healthier environment and society.

# Key Projects

## Projects with Local Communities

ThaiBev has implemented several projects that aim to help conserve upstream forests and watersheds and protect water sources that are vital to local communities. Here are some of the showcase examples of ThaiBev’s community water management activities and projects.

### Sharing Water to the Community

In 2021, ThaiBev continued its commitment to ensure local communities and the agricultural sector receive clean water. The spirits business group initiated a CSR activity titled ‘Fuengfuanant, Sharing Water to the Community.’ Through this project, the factory in Prachinburi Province helped release clean, treated water to farmers and supported the community with Effective Microorganism (EM) water to be applied to the water resources, which not only help prevent water spoilage during harvest season but also helps treat the water of nearby rivers and canals. In addition, the spirits factory in Surat Thani Province has provided 1,230 kilograms of alum, a chemical used for water purification, to villages in Moo 2 and 4 in Tha Rong Chang Sub-district, Surat Thani Province. The factory also helped educate people on how to improve the quality of the tap water they consume.

### Clean Drinking Water for the Children and Community

In 2021, ThaiBev continued to undertake its initiative to ensure local communities, especially children, receive clean drinking water. It also plans to expand the project so that all schools and communities around their factories have access to clean drinking water. This year, the project was expanded to cover two more schools, including Wat Monthon Prasit School in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province and Wat Sawang Phoo School in Pathum Thani Province. ThaiBev also helped educate people on how to improve, use, and maintain the water filtration system at these schools. Other spirits businesses in the group have also supported this project to meet the community’s needs for clean drinking water in Nakhon Pathom and Ubon Ratchathani Provinces.

### Promoting Ecological Conservation and Caring for Community Water Resources

The beer factory in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province together with the community and stakeholders of the Khlong Soi 26, Rangsit Nuea and Rapipat irrigation canals in Bangkok jointly released 100,000 fish into the water to increase the concentration of fish. They also helped increase the proportion of green spaces around the factories and communities by distributing seedlings to employees and villagers and planting trees. This collaboration between the government, community, and factories is improving the area’s natural water resources and restoring its natural ecosystems.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

The spirits factory collaborated with the industrial sector in Pathum Thani Province as well as government agencies, the private sector, and community leaders to run a volunteer project to preserve tributaries of the Pasak River Basin all the way to the Chao Phraya River in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province and Pathum Thani Province. The project helped 40 households around factories, especially those next to rivers and canals, install grease traps to reduce the release of waste water and household fats into community water sources and the Chao Phraya River. Another benefit of the project was that it helped to create more awareness about the issue of river waste amongst the government and community.

In addition, volunteer employees from the spirits factory engaged in CSR activities with the Surat Thani Industrial Bureau and the Surat Thani Inland Fisheries Research and Development Center to help preserve the Tapi River. Starting in 2021, this project for river basin management and environmental governance is located at Klong Phum Duang. Volunteers helped to release 25,000 herbivorous fish into the river, plant auspicious trees, and provide grease traps to people in the Wat Suwankot area of Surat Thani Province and Bueng Nong Han.

## Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels

ThaiBev’s 11 factories joined the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) and the Water and Environment Institute for Sustainability (WEIS) in the Industrial Managed Aquifer Recharge at Shallow Levels Program. The project will act as the prototype factories on how to harvest rainwater and conserve shallow underground water without affecting the ecosystem and the environment. ThaiBev is working on expanding the project to cover more locations nationwide. This project is significant for featuring the collaborative participation of the government, the industrial sectors and local communities.

## Wastewater Management Through Artificial Wetlands

The Knockdhu Distillery Co., Ltd., a subsidiary company in Scotland, developed an artificial wetland in the 2,000 square meters of land in the factory area in order to manage the wastewater created from the distillation process. The company planted 17 different species of plants and over 21,000 individual plants. The wetland attracts insects, which in turn attract bats and birds, increasing the biodiversity of the area. This wetland has reduced carbon emissions by 45 tonnes per year, as effluent waste no longer needed to be trucked out of the factory.

# Packaging and Circular Economy

Environmental considerations are increasingly vital factors in product packaging. In recent years, ThaiBev has reduced the amount of resources needed to produce its packaging and used more sustainable and environmentally friendly materials in its packaging. Furthermore, the company has worked to create new recycling opportunities post-consumption, as another way to increase resource efficiency and reduce waste, especially with primary packaging materials such as glass, paper, aluminium cans, and PET bottles. ThaiBev even has a subsidiary, Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd. (TBR), that is dedicated to the collection of post-consumption packaging for reuse or recycling.

Increasingly, the world recognizes the importance of maximizing resource efficiency and transitioning to a circular economy. For example, Thailand’s government approved a draft action plan in 2021 to phase out and ban four types of plastic products and to recycle at least 50% of seven types of plastics by 2022. ThaiBev also believes that the reduction of its GHG emissions through materials efficiency and the proper handling of company-related packaging waste is a good business opportunity that will reduce operational expenses. ThaiBev works with various stakeholders throughout its value chain, including Tier 1 and non-Tier 1 suppliers, small business owners, and consumers, to manage and create value for post-consumption packaging via the circular economy model.

# Management Approach

ThaiBev adheres to the circular economy principle and considers all environmental and social impacts arising from its packaging, from design to post-consumption packaging management. To help achieve more sustainable packaging management, ThaiBev focuses on five actions:

1. **Optimization of Packaging Weight and Volume**
2. **Post-consumption Packaging Collection and Sorting**
3. **Reuse and Recycle**
4. **Innovation and Product Design**
5. **Stakeholder Collaboration**

## 1. Optimization of Packaging Weight and Volume

ThaiBev works with its business partners to develop packaging that uses fewer natural resources while maintaining quality and functionality. By 2030, ThaiBev is determined to reduce the amount of raw materials used for aluminum can production by 2,700 tons compared to 2020. In FY2021, ThaiBev successfully optimized the weight of multiple packaging materials, resulting in a reduction of more than 407 tons of materials.

## 2. Post-consumption Packaging Collection and Sorting

A crucial part of closed-loop packaging management is to collect and sort post-consumption packaging. TBR retrieves ThaiBev’s post-consumption packaging collected via local business partners throughout the country and sorts them at company-owned sorting facilities. Main packaging materials retrieved by TBR include glass bottles, cullet, aluminum cans, PET bottles, and corrugated cartons.

## 3. Reuse and Recycle

In order to ensure efficient closed-loop post-consumption packaging management, TBR sends sorted post-consumption packaging directly to intended users, such as manufacturers and recyclers. Initiatives have also been put in place for secondary packaging. This includes the use in logistics of a returnable plastic sheet, which is designed to be reused at least 50 times, instead of disposable paper trays. In the beginning of FY 2021, TBR opened a new recycling centre in Nakhon Ratchasima Province. This is in addition to 30 existing points of purchase and another recycling centre in Ayutthaya. The new facility was built as part of the company’s roadmap to strengthen its recycling infrastructure in strategic locations. The company also has plans to construct recycling centres in northern and southern Thailand.

Apart from post-consumption packaging, TBR also manages kitchen utensils and POP (point-of-purchase)/POS (point-of-sales) materials from ThaiBev’s restaurants – repairing or refurbishing so they can be utilized again.

## 4. Innovation and Product Design for Sustainable Packaging

ThaiBev established BevTech Co., Ltd. (BevTech) as a Research and Development centre with one branch, the Packaging Business, that develops sustainable packaging and alternatives. BevTech also researches machines and robotics to facilitate automation in ThaiBev’s production facilities. The goal is to add capacity to the business, increase efficiency and the quality of production, as well as to enhance safety in the workplace, reduce labour risks, and reduce waste and energy consumption, which could create negative environmental impacts. BevTech’s major achievement in recent years has been the implementation of an automated bottle-sorting conveyor belt and the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) bottle-sorting technology through collaboration with CMKL University. This collaboration established a partnership between King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a leading university in AI technology. The solution optimized ThaiBev’s bottle-sorting processes by reducing human error, reusable packaging losses, and overall operating costs.

## 5. Stakeholder Collaboration

ThaiBev engages with stakeholders throughout its value chain to ensure end-to-end sustainable packaging management. It also works closely with TIPMSE (Thailand Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment) of The Federation of Thai Industries and has assigned representatives to the TIPMSE Executive Board. ThaiBev also recently joined TIPMSE in developing the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for Thailand. The EPR working team is comprised of academics and members of the private sector.

# 2021 Highlight

## "Bring Back-Recycle"

To create awareness about post-consumption packaging management, TBR launched the "Bring Back-Recycle" programme in FY 2019 and organized engagement activities to encourage end users to participate in waste-sorting so that post-consumption packaging can be properly managed. This campaign started off as an internal recycling campaign, in which employees were encouraged to separate recyclable post-consumption packaging and donate proceeds to ThaiBev’s employees’ fund. Later, the campaign expanded to other offices, including 17 locations in Bangkok. The company developed the OK Recycle smartphone application to promote participation in these activities. It uses demand-and-supply-matching mechanisms to connect buyers and sellers (recyclers). Additionally, the application systematically records recycling activities and other relevant information.

In collaboration with the Water Festival Thailand 2021, TBR launched the “Sufficient Community for Sustainable World” activity, which involves creating a sustainable recycling loop through waste separation at the community level. The community development activity kicked off with four pilot regions in late March 2021. Moreover, to allow ThaiBev’s consumers to properly manage post-consumption packaging, TBR has created a database for recycling drop-off points at [www.bringbackrecycle.com/recycle](http://www.bringbackrecycle.com/recycle). The database began as a collaboration programme between Bring Back-Recycle and its partners, including WON project, Precious Plastic Bangkok, Frasers Property Thailand, and various governmental agencies across the country. In addition, TBR also participated in a nationwide recycling campaign hosted by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand) and Thai Beverage Can Ltd., one of ThaiBev’s major aluminium can suppliers, to retrieve post-consumption aluminium cans from Big C, one of Thailand’s largest retailers. The database currently features more than 860 drop points for recyclable post-consumption packaging, such as PET bottles, HDPE bottle caps, aluminium cans, and stretchable plastics, i.e. plastic bags and films made of LDPE. Consumers can also access the database via a QR code on Chang-brand packaging.

# Key Projects

## Creating Value through Recycled Materials

Creating demand for post-consumption packaging is a key driver in sustainable packaging management under the circular economy model. Although the use of recycled PET in food packaging is prohibited by the Thai FDA, ThaiBev sees opportunities to explore the use of recycled PET (rPET) in other applications, such as textiles, to create value for post-consumption PET bottles and encourage proper recycling of PET through upcycling. 

One of ThaiBev’s most prominent efforts over the past two years involved retrieving over 15.2 million post-consumption PET bottles and upcycling them into 400,000 PET blankets. These were then donated under the campaign “ThaiBev... Unites to Fight the Cold,” a project ongoing for 22 consecutive years. 2021 marks the second consecutive year that ThaiBev has upcycled PET to make these blankets. Under this initiative, ThaiBev has successfully created awareness about the value of post-consumption packaging. In addition to the blankets, ThaiBev has also helped to fuel demand through partnership programmes to upcycle rPET into textile products, such as tote bag souvenirs at the Thailand Sustainability Expo and football jerseys for Buriram United.

## Waste Inventory (WIN) System

ThaiBev applies the circular economy principle in its waste management approach, striving to minimize the impact of waste on the environment and society. Waste Inventory, or WIN, a centralized waste management database, was invented to capture waste and all data in the ThaiBev Group. The system uses a stock balance approach to calculate the amount of waste based on “stock in” and “stock out” data. WIN users include stakeholders throughout ThaiBev’s value chain, allowing the company to visualize its waste universe via a single dashboard, and effectively allocate R&D resources to transform waste into value through innovation.

Examples of ThaiBev’s value-added waste innovation include hand cream containing extract from tea-leaf residue, art pieces made from beverage labels collected during the bottle washing process, and other porous and lightweight materials, such as Green Rock, developed from the byproducts of incineration through a collaboration with the National Science and Technology Development Agency and the National Metal and Materials Technology Center.

## Bring Back Home

In 2020, ThaiBev invited agents (customers) to join its Bring Back Home programme, through which they can create collection hubs for post-consumption packaging. In this take-back model, agents collect packaging from retail stores and restaurants (their direct customers). The packaging is then collected through backhaul logistics. This new programme optimizes fuel efficiency and allows ThaiBev to retrieve post-consumption packaging directly from customers, and also to ensure it is properly managed. Since this programme was launched, ThaiBev has retrieved over 148 tons of post-consumption packaging.

![Flowchart of Bring Back Home Programme](https://example.com/flowchart)

# KFC Green Stores

ThaiBev has implemented multiple initiatives to phase out single-use plastics. The company aims to align with Thailand’s national roadmap to end the use of disposable plastics and impose a ban on single-use plastic items, including lightweight plastic bags and cups, and plastic straws in 2022. The QSR of Asia Co., Ltd. under ThaiBev, joined hands with KFC under Yum Restaurants International (Thailand) Co., Ltd. to open two KFC Green Stores in Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima provinces. These stores encourage customers to participate in environmental conservation efforts, aligning with KFC’s principle “Done the Right Way.” This is practiced through quality ingredients, fresh and clean food, and a determination to conserve the earth. The coming concept “KFC Fast Good” encourages people to do good things that are sustainable for the world.

At two KFC Green Store branches, customers are encouraged to reduce their consumption of single-use plastics. These branches have switched their packaging materials to feature minimum plastic. This includes new knives and forks with 20% less plastic, and switching to water-based coat instead of PE film-coated soda cups, biodegradable PLA straws, paper sauce cups, and thicker plastic bags. Moreover, solar panels have been installed on the rooftops to generate power for the restaurants. This initiative has reduced the use of electricity by 20%. These branches also installed new air-purification systems. The stores have also partnered with IRPC to encourage customers to sort their own waste (knives, forks, spoons, and mashed potato cups) and recycle them. New KFC Green Stores will encourage customers to cooperate with post-consumer waste-sorting and recycling processes under circular economy principles.

# Crystal CAN

Crystal, one of Thailand’s leading drinking water brands, recently launched Crystal CAN, quality drinking water sold in aluminum cans. The product is a collaboration between ThaiBev Group and its key aluminium packaging supplier to create a closed-loop packaging management system and generate awareness among consumers regarding the environmental impacts of post-consumption packaging. As an alternative to PET bottles, aluminium cans are 100% recyclable. The use of recycled aluminium also reduces the energy used in can manufacturing by up to 95 percent, compared to the use of virgin aluminium. This initiative is part of Crystal’s sustainable development programme under the concept “Crystal CARE,” which emphasizes the brand’s social and environmental responsibility.

# Unscrewing Aluminum Cap and Tear Off Machine

Glass bottle is considered one of ThaiBev’s main packaging with more than 1.2 billion bottles being reused in production process annually. In order to increase the efficiency of sorting glass bottles for reuse and recycling, ThaiBev worked with its business partner to develop a machine that unscrews aluminum cap and cut off cap’s skirts from post-consumption glass bottles. The machine is installed as part of bottle-sorting line and capable of processing up to 15,000 bottles per hour at optimum capacity.

# With PASSION 2025 Commitment

For the past few years, ThaiBev has worked hard to embrace the transition to a circular economy by focusing on collection and sorting systems, research and development of materials, and partnerships with suppliers and other stakeholders. This helped strengthen ThaiBev’s supply chain, resulting in cost and process optimization, and supported the company’s vision to be a leader and to promote good practices within the sector.


# Achievements

ThaiBev has succeeded in receiving group-wide commitments to its various programmes that address environmental impacts related to packaging.

| Reused | Recycled | Recycled | Recycled |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1,277 million glass bottles and Recycled 207,688 tons of cullet, representing 82%* of products sold in Thailand** | 103,789.96 tons of corrugated cartons, representing 166% of the company’s paper packaging consumption in Thailand | 1,803.00 tons of aluminium cans, representing 30% of products sold in Thailand | 3,188.49 tons of PET bottles, representing 10% of products sold in Thailand |

\*based on packaging weight of sales volume  
\**Include returnable glass bottles used by Spirits, Beer and Non-alcoholic beverage groups

# COVID-19 Response

ThaiBev has put in place COVID-19 response measures at all post-consumption packaging management facilities to ensure the health and safety of employees, as well as partners along the supply chain. In addition to standard COVID-19 measures, routine cleaning, using disinfectants approved by the health department, are performed by safety personnel to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

# SDG Indicators

With its firm commitment to embrace the circular economy model through its waste management system, implementation of 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) concept, and emphasis on innovation, ThaiBev is contributing to:

12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse

# Towards 2025 and Beyond

| 2025 Goals: | 2030 Goals: |
|-------------|------------|
| Retrieve 100% of glass and paper packaging sold in Thailand for reuse or recycling | Retrieve 100% of PET bottles and aluminium cans sold in Thailand |
| 100% of main packaging used in production processes are reusable, recyclable, or compostable materials | Reduce raw materials used for aluminium can production by 2,700 tons (2020 base year) |

# Biodiversity

Global loss of biodiversity is increasingly recognized as one of climate change’s most significant consequences. To make sure ecosystems remain resilient and minimize any disruption to the environmental balance society relies on, ThaiBev recognizes biodiversity as a material issue and is committed to a net positive impact on biodiversity across its global operations. As the company’s headquarters and majority of operations are in Southeast Asia, many of ThaiBev’s businesses are located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, underlining the need for ThaiBev to be proactive on this issue. In 2021, ThaiBev embarked on the first year of ThaiBev’s biodiversity action plan by performing a systematic screening of global operations to identify the company’s impacts on biodiversity.

# Management Approach

In FY 2021 ThaiBev announced two bold commitments related to biodiversity:

- A net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030
- No gross deforestation in ThaiBev’s operations by 2030

Both these commitments extend to the supply chain. ThaiBev requires tier 1 and non-tier 1 suppliers to avoid negative impacts on biodiversity. ThaiBev has worked with external partners such as suppliers, NGOs, and communities, and will continue to do so in the long term to ensure commitments are met. These commitments are in line with international pledges to reverse nature loss by 2030.

ThaiBev’s no gross deforestation commitment involves stringent measures and monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance throughout the supply chain. Suppliers shall adhere to “no gross deforestation” as part of ThaiBev’s supplier guidelines, and the company also performs supplier engagement and audits to verify progress towards the commitment. As ThaiBev’s exposure to deforestation within its own direct operations is minimal, such efforts are mainly focused on the supply chain and procurement processes.

ThaiBev has incorporated the mitigation hierarchy into company procedures (avoid, minimize, restore and offset) to manage potential biodiversity risks related to production facilities.

## Avoidance

ThaiBev is committed to implementing avoidance measures, i.e., measures to ‘design out’ an impact or risk to prevent impacts expected on biodiversity. ThaiBev will also employ design criteria to evaluate all infrastructure development options and look at alternatives when significant impacts to biodiversity are likely. The key good practice avoidance measures include:

- Avoid developing in nationally or internationally recognized areas of high biodiversity value which include:
  - UNESCO World Heritage Sites;
  - Wetlands listed in the Ramsar list of sites;
  - UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) reserves;
  - Key Biodiversity Areas; and
  - Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites
  - IUCN Category I-IV protected areas.

- Relocate project facilities away from areas containing critical biodiversity, where feasible.

- Avoid clearing forested areas for the development of project facilities.

## Minimization

ThaiBev is committed to implementing minimization measures to reduce the severity of impacts on biodiversity by controlling or limiting the sources of impact at production facilities in development/operation. Factories that discharge water from operations always comply with local legislation to avoid impacts on biodiversity. Similarly, all operations apply appropriate measures to limit noise to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) ensuring protection to employees and the natural environment surrounding the factories.

## Restoration / Rehabilitation

ThaiBev seeks to restore/rehabilitate areas where impacts cannot be prevented. Where existing operational sites were developed on degraded forest areas, ThaiBev intends to restore such areas to a better quality to enable the company to make a positive contribution to the landscape and local environment.

## Offset

ThaiBev will seek to assess the need for, and feasibility of achieving no net loss of biodiversity for its production facilities with negative biodiversity impacts through compensation/offset measures. Such measures will be developed in line with international best practices such as the Principles on Biodiversity Offsets developed by the Business and Biodiversity Offset Program (BBOP).

# 2021 Highlight

## Critical Habitats and Species Assessments

ThaiBev began studying the company's exposure to critical biodiversity, starting with its own operations in FY 2021. A desktop screening was performed first to pinpoint focus areas for further study. Satellite mapping was used to measure the distance of ThaiBev's operations from internationally recognized and important biodiversity areas, or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs). A risk categorization was then defined using 0 km as very high risk, 0 to 2 km as high risk, 2 to 5 km as moderate risk, and greater than 5 km as low risk. The internationally recognized Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) was used as the global database for biodiversity areas. ThaiBev defined sites to be in proximity to biodiversity if they were located within 5 km to KBAs.

In addition to using IBAT, ThaiBev undertook species-screening to identify sites that may comprise critical habitat to species. Screening is crucial in order to minimize the risk of ThaiBev's operations negatively impacting biodiversity and causing irreparable damage to the environment. Species-screening took place within a 10 km buffer around each factory, using IFC PS6 Critical Habitat Assessment criteria 1, 2, and 3. Any factory for which the 10 km surrounding buffer triggered any of the criteria was categorized a Critical Habitat and flagged for further study.

From the desktop assessment, 34 sites were identified for further study in the second half of FY 2021. This further study involved a gap analysis to determine which policies and procedures should be implemented at each site to eliminate biodiversity impacts.

The species-screening study was also refined to improve accuracy, species flagged for Criteria 1 and 2 of IFC PS6 were examined more closely and ThaiBev collaborated with experts such as academics and NGOs to support the overall assessments. Where necessary, targeted field surveys were also performed to confirm the presence of qualifying species. This work improved the accuracy of assessing which species are present in areas close to ThaiBev's operations and this knowledge was also provided to local residents so they could be aware of the critical species present within their communities.

In parallel, ThaiBev refined the results for sites that were flagged as <5 km from KBAs. Key stakeholders such as the Key Biodiversity Area Secretariat, BirdLife local partners, and others were consulted to further understand the site and the surrounding region.

From these expert consultations, ThaiBev finalized a global list of sites that are exposed to critical biodiversity and should be targeted for impact assessment in the future. Impacts will be assessed on a site-specific basis and biodiversity management plans will be developed to ensure a net positive impact on biodiversity in line with ThaiBev's commitments. Regarding sites that were identified at the high-level study as in proximity to critical biodiversity but then ruled out during the refined assessment stage, ThaiBev has still taken on board the high-level findings and will engage with local bodies and communities to raise awareness about these critical species and support efforts to boost the populations of these species. This will provide wider benefits to the local community such as ecotourism and safeguard ecology in the local area for future generations.

As a result of the phase 2 study, ThaiBev has determined that 21 sites are in proximity to critical biodiversity. This presents great opportunities for the company to protect the critical areas and species around operations and work with communities to preserve nature. In FY 2022, ThaiBev will carry out further work to identify all impacts the company has that may adversely impact biodiversity and prepare tailored Biodiversity Management Plans for each site.

| Total number and area of ThaiBev’s operations | 42 | 1773.4 ha |
|-----------------------------------------------|----|-----------|
| Number and area of sites in proximity to critical biodiversity | 21 | 963.5 ha |

## Key Projects

- ThaiBev encourages landscaping at all factories to comprise native plant species. This promotes local insect and bird populations, contributing to a positive impact on biodiversity. Factories also limit the use of pesticides to avoid negative impacts on biodiversity in line with ThaiBev’s environmental policy.

- Factories that discharge effluent from operations fully comply with local legislation at all sites to ensure minimum impacts on biodiversity. Noise reduction and containment measures are taken to ensure zero impact on biodiversity from machinery or other operations on-site.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

- ThaiBev’s Scottish distillery subsidiary, Inver House, has championed biodiversity efforts. Knockdhu distillery has converted 2,000 m² of land on the distillery to wetlands, boosting local insects, bats, and bird populations. Another distillery, Speyburn, has worked with Spey Fishery Board to carry out annual surveys of fish populations in the local water body and install a fish pass. The surveys have been performed since 2012 and have shown an increase in trout and salmon populations.

## With PASSION 2025 Commitment

ThaiBev’s Climate Strategy, launched in 2020, also covers the importance of biodiversity through the plan’s key pillars of “mitigation” and “communities”. For example, ThaiBev works with local communities to implement biodiversity restoration projects such as tree planting, water body cleaning, and mangrove restoration in the surrounding areas of factories. As part of ThaiBev’s 3rd Climate Strategy pillar: “communities”, ThaiBev will be boosting and supporting mangrove restoration efforts in the Inner Gulf of Thailand. Mangroves have been identified as powerful carbon sinks with the ability to store carbon for millennia, and at a volume of up to 10 times more than forests, while also providing habitat for fauna.

### Achievements

ThaiBev has committed to a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030, in comparison with 2021 levels. ThaiBev is still in the process of identifying impacts on biodiversity from operations and will annually update the progress of this commitment.

ThaiBev’s commitment to eliminate deforestation by 2030 through its own operations and the supply chain has commenced by introducing monitoring mechanisms and supplier guidelines into ThaiBev’s policies. ThaiBev will annually update the progress towards eliminating deforestation from the supply chain ahead of the 2030 goal by engaging with suppliers and identifying risk areas.

In FY 2021, ThaiBev fully defined the company’s exposure to critical biodiversity through a systematic assessment of all sites. The company has 21 sites exposed to critical biodiversity, amounting to a land mass of 963.5 hectares. By FY 2022, 100% of sites exposed to critical biodiversity will have biodiversity management plans in place.

## SDG Indicators

ThaiBev’s commitment to biodiversity and no deforestation aligns with and contributes to the company’s aspirations to UN SDG 15 “Life on Land”.

- **15.1:** Ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. ThaiBev will proactively work to ensure conservation, set baseline levels, and restore biodiversity areas in proximity to operations to guarantee a net positive impact.

- **15.2:** Promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally. ThaiBev has pledged to halt deforestation by its own operations, tier-1, and non-tier 1 suppliers, covering all continents.

- **15.5:** Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.

- **15.9:** By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts. ThaiBev has incorporated biodiversity into the company’s Climate Strategy “Pillar 3: Communities”. By working towards its net-positive impact to biodiversity commitment, ThaiBev can work with communities around factories, facilitating knowledge sharing and the creation of ecotourism opportunities.

# Food Loss and Waste

According to the United Nations, at least one-third of all food, by weight, is lost or wasted. Globally, this has significant environmental impacts and is a factor driving climate change, since waste that decomposes in landfills generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has estimated that 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with unconsumed food. To help address this problem, ThaiBev is working to reduce its food loss and waste inventories and ensure that resources are used more efficiently to minimize their environmental impacts.

These challenges facilitate the company’s efforts to transition towards a circular economy. This is particularly evident in the composting of food waste. As ASEAN’s leading food and beverage producer, ThaiBev uses significant resources to manufacture its products. The company has already begun an initiative, for instance, to convert food waste into fertilizer. ThaiBev also views the issue of food loss and waste as a financial opportunity. As a good example of financial benefits from food loss and waste management, the Food Group has generated total revenue of 21,790,185 THB from various types of food loss and waste in 2021.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

Target 12.3 of the UN SDGs calls for halving food loss and waste per capita by 2030. ThaiBev has set a similar but more ambitious goal. ThaiBev aims to eliminate food loss and waste discarded to landfills to zero by 2030. This means that by 2030, all food loss and waste generated by ThaiBev will be purposely used elsewhere. ThaiBev has devised several methods and strategies across four business units (Spirits, Beer, Non-Alcoholic Beverages and Food) to reduce the total volume of food loss and waste generated along the value chain as well as the volume of food loss and waste discarded. Those include selling raw material waste to create animal feed and donating safe and high-quality food surpluses to underprivileged people. Furthermore, the company aims to work with all of its stakeholders to innovatively track and reduce food loss and waste throughout the value chain.

## Management Approach

Food loss and food waste have related, but different meanings based on where they occur in the value chain. Food loss is the decreased quantity or quality of food from harvesting, transporting, and production up to – but excluding – the retail level, while food waste occurs at the retail and consumption level. ThaiBev also categorizes food loss and waste based on where the food loss and waste occur.

ThaiBev uses various systems to measure food loss and waste. At production sites, food loss is accumulated, measured, categorized, and stored before it gets managed. The company records the amount of food loss at production sites, which allows it to trace the loss back to where it occurred. ThaiBev also uses other methods to measure the amount of food loss and waste, including by calculating the weight difference between full and empty truckloads. At the retail level, ThaiBev uses several methods to measure food waste, including by weighing food waste at each restaurant or calculating waste using the inventory system.

# Food Loss and Waste

## Food Loss

One of ThaiBev’s top priorities is to accurately track and record any losses that occur within its manufacturing processes. The company then analyses where and why these losses occurred, and develops goals for better management procedures. These assessments minimize losses in each process and maximize the reuse of what would otherwise be lost during production.

To reduce food loss, the company also works with its suppliers to ensure that raw materials meet quality standards and are not lost due to poor packaging or transport practices. ThaiBev also manages and sorts food loss according to different categories, while tracking the monthly volume for each waste disposal method. This data is maintained and monitored in order to meet the company’s reduction targets.

Most importantly, ThaiBev collaborated with upstream and downstream partners to create innovative new products and programmes to reduce food loss. Among the company’s key innovations are:

- Transforming vegetable waste into fertilizer
- Reutilizing bread crumbs and salmon waste in new food products
- Selling raw material waste to be used as animal feed
- Selling used oil to suppliers to produce biodiesel.

## Food Waste

ThaiBev is continuously working to improve data accuracy for food waste, collecting information from all of its retail stores. ThaiBev has also integrated improvements in its processes to reduce waste, for example, by applying the Waste Inventory Database (WIN), adapting and bridging current restaurant programmes, and standardizing restaurant databases in order to improve its analytical capabilities.

The company also works with logistics partners licensed in waste handling to ensure that waste is collected and handled properly. To avoid potential safety and hygiene issues, food waste, which is highly perishable, must be dealt with swiftly.

ThaiBev is exploring various methods to create new value-added uses for its food waste, including by selling food loss at production plants to pet food or feed manufacturers, and donating surplus food from its restaurant chains to organizations and communities.

## 2021 Highlight

Each ThaiBev business unit has created its own way to manage food loss in the production process. ThaiBev is careful with food loss tracking and recording during the manufacturing process to ensure data accuracy.

Food loss is then categorized and recorded separately based on the type of materials, allowing the company to manage it most effectively, since each material ends up in a different destination.

Spirits, Beer, and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Product Groups boasted a perfect track record managing food loss in 2021, they reported zero food loss from their production sites. The Food Group also had success in managing its food loss and waste to ensure the least environmental impact. For example, the food loss was used for alternative purposes such as animal feed, alternative energy resource, fertilizer, and consumable by-product to provide another source of revenue such as fried salmon skin. Vegetable scraps found at food production sites have also been composted and used as fertilizers in its own location or supported to the local communities. Only 1,015.28 metric tonnes from the Food Group were sent to landfills.

# Key Projects

## KFC’s Food Initiatives

- **KFC Harvest Program**
  - Surplus food is donated directly to people living in disadvantaged circumstances. Currently, The QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) of Asia, or QSA, provides surplus food to 10 vocational institutes across Thailand, including Baan Metta (Korat Province), Baan Wangthong (Phitsanulok Province), Baan Rachawadee (Nonthaburi Province), Baan Maharaj (Pathumthani Province), and Baan Tubkwang (Saraburi Province), among others. In 2021, KFC has donated 8,454.61 kilograms of high-quality food.

- **KFC Colonel’s Kitchen Project**
  - Food safety and hygiene are vital contributors to one's quality of life. This project improves the lives of underprivileged people living in homeless shelters by supporting improvements to the shelters’ kitchens. In 2021, a total of 5,639,514 THB was invested in 2 shelters in Chiang Mai and Saraburi Provinces.

## Other ThaiBev Initiatives to Support the Reduction of Food Waste Include:

- **Zero Food Waste Challenge**
  - Shabushi (Shabu Buffet restaurant chain) created the “Kin Mod Kleang” challenge for its customers. “Kin Mod Kleang” means “Eat it all so there’s nothing left.” The slogan reminds people to be considerate and reduce their food waste.
  - In general, ThaiBev embraces its role in mitigating global food loss and waste. Over the next decade, the company plans to help the world and its businesses and suppliers achieve these targets. The benefits of managing food loss and waste effectively are clear to everyone, so ThaiBev looks forward to tackling this challenge with all relevant stakeholders.

- **Food Surplus Donation in Collaboration with the Scholars of Sustenance (SOS) Foundation**
  - The OISHI Group works with the SOS foundation to donate food surplus to various vulnerable communities. The foundation works with restaurants in different locations, to pick up the food surplus (either raw or cooked). Restaurants are given instructions on how to store the food, including whether containers are necessary, and what food categories are accepted to ensure the safety of those receiving the food. Currently, three restaurants in the OISHI Group are collaborating with the SOS foundation. They are Shabushi and OISHI Eaterium at Samyan Mitrtown and Shabushi at Central Plaza Ladprao. In 2021, these three restaurants combined have donated 553.4 kilograms of food surplus to the foundation. The food was distributed to various communities in Bangkok.

- **Selling Used Cooking Oil to Produce Biodiesel**
  - In 2021, 947.74 metric tonnes of used cooking oil from restaurants were sold to produce biodiesel. ThaiBev believes this alternative source of energy could also help mitigate climate change.

## With PASSION 2025 Commitment

To align with the three key strategies of ThaiBev’s PASSION 2025: BUILD, STRENGTHEN, and UNLOCK, ThaiBev’s food loss and waste management focused on UNLOCK to help reduce the amount of food loss and waste discarded to landfills, such as new destinations for current food loss and waste or the expansion of current solutions. ThaiBev will also expand food loss and waste tracking and management beyond Thailand to include all international operation sites in the future. These initiatives provide ThaiBev with opportunities to work with its stakeholders and partners to achieve the best outcomes.

# Achievements

In 2021, ThaiBev's total food loss and waste volume was 2,548.20 metric tonnes in Thailand.

## Total Food Loss and Waste

**2,548.20 metric tonnes in Thailand**

Of this, 1,532.93 metric tonnes of food loss and waste was utilized for alternative purposes. The breakdown was as follows:

- **Food loss and waste sold as animal feed** amounted to **538.78 metric tonnes**
- **Food loss and waste sold to produce biodiesel** amounted to **947.74 metric tonnes**
- **Food loss and waste transformed into fertilizer** amounted to **30.38 metric tonnes**
- **Food loss sold as by-products** amounted to **0.40 metric tonnes**
- **Food waste donated** amounted to **15.63 metric tonnes**

Thus, in 2021, only 1,015.27 metric tonnes, or 39.85% of total food loss and waste were discarded and sent to landfills. This means that the other 60.15%, or approximately 1,532.93 metric tonnes, were redirected and used for alternative purposes.

# COVID-19 Response

Food loss and waste management were both impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The volume of food loss and waste, especially food waste from restaurants, significantly decreased due to pandemic prevention measures that restricted in-restaurant dining and temporarily closed restaurants in some locations. During this period, restaurants have focused more on takeaway and delivery to minimize person-to-person contact and the risk of infection. This resulted in less food waste at many restaurants. Moreover, raw material purchasing involved more careful analysis of current trends to ensure that materials were fully utilized without going to waste. With the increase in online delivery orders, restaurants have adjusted and repriced their menus to be more suitable for delivery, while also creating new special promotions. These adjustments helped reduce in-store food waste and maximized the use of raw materials. Moreover, ThaiBev has adjusted its packaging to accommodate increasing delivery orders. These measures include:

1. Using 100% recyclable plastic in packaging
2. Using natural materials with high decomposition rates
3. Redesigning packaging to use less plastic

Examples include replacing plastic bags for utensils with Polypropylene packaging, the replacement of plastic gyoza trays with paper boxes, the use of 100% HD Recyclable bags, and the use of polylactic acid (PLA), which has a high decomposition rate. Some plastic bags provided to customers are made with thicker and more durable plastic, so they can be reused many times.

# SDG Indicators

ThaiBev’s food loss and waste management contributes to SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.

![SDG 12 Logo](image)

**SDG 12.5:** By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycle and reuse.

Many ThaiBev initiatives seek to support SDG 12.5 by repurposing food loss and waste. The company is working to reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. ThaiBev is committed to reducing food waste and loss from its operations and where possible to encourage customers to adopt new habits. This includes ensuring that all people have access to healthy food through surplus food donations.



# Towards 2025 and Beyond

## Goals

- Zero food loss and waste to landfills by 2030

## Moving Forward

- Food waste reduction campaign and initiatives will be expanded to cover all ThaiBev restaurant chains.
- ThaiBev is seeking new possibilities to help with food loss and waste reduction and management.



# Caring for People

ThaiBev has always been deeply committed to the wellbeing of its employees, partners, customers, and stakeholders. The company’s culture of professionalism and excellence can be seen in its employee training programs, its advocacy and respect for diversity, and myriad other beneficial opportunities for employees. During the COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years, ThaiBev has created new initiatives that directly assist our employees, suppliers, and the wider public in order to meet this challenge together.

# Employee Wellbeing

ThaiBev cares deeply about its employees’ safety and wellbeing, and constantly strives to promote the safety of all stakeholders in its operations. The company believes that employees work more effectively and efficiently when they are in a happy workplace with eased minds. As part of this effort, ThaiBev has produced guidelines and safety management systems to ensure that the company remains in line with legal and international standards on safety, occupational health and working environments for its employees, business partners and other stakeholders. This includes risk prevention measures for accidents, injuries, and illnesses linked to operations, along with support to improve working environments that promote employees’ physical and emotional wellbeing as well as their quality of work life. To address unique COVID-19 challenges, a special pandemic management plan was developed to maximize the safety of all stakeholders in the value chain.

Across the world, COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of employee wellbeing. ThaiBev sees tremendous benefit in creating employee health and wellbeing plans to deal with unexpected scenarios, whether they be humanitarian crises, natural disasters or global pandemics like COVID-19. ThaiBev is always working to better equip itself to deal with such challenges and to support its employees and their families.

# Strategy

To meet legal and internal standards, ThaiBev has set guidelines for safety, occupational health, and working environments in four areas:

1. Safety
2. Occupational Health
3. Working Environment
4. Employee Wellbeing

## Management Approach

This year, ThaiBev worked to become stronger than ever by establishing new capabilities. Focused on improving its workforce, equipment, procedures, and infrastructure, the company attempted to become a best-practice leader in safety, occupational health, and wellbeing. In 2021, ThaiBev continued to respond to COVID-19 and the pandemic’s outsized impact on the safety, health, and wellbeing of employees. This allowed ThaiBev to build new capabilities and strengthen its current framework.

## The New Normal

### Work-from-home arrangements

- ThaiBev values a flexible workplace, including working from home. It believes this option increases productivity, morale, agility, and cross-business collaboration. For employee safety and wellbeing, ThaiBev implemented a work-from-home policy as the unfavourable situation could harm employees’ health and safety. These include environmental issues such as PM2.5, political unrest, and pandemics. ThaiBev has also announced strict protocols for working from home during COVID-19 to ensure that all employees are safe. ThaiBev supports employees working from home, helping them achieve high performance by offering training, equipment, and tools. Wellness programs have been adjusted to promote exercise, ergonomics, and stress management. ThaiBev has also arranged effective work-from-home situations with disabled employees who face difficulties travelling to work.

### Beverest Life

- In 2020-2021, ThaiBev implemented a no-contact procedure for employees to check-in to their work through an internal mobile application, Beverest Life, which was deployed by the human capital team to all employees. This application will be used going forward as part of a standard safety measure to increase efficiency, decrease contact, and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

## Safety

- The company’s central safety team continues to conduct periodic on-site safety inspections at all facilities. This includes ThaiBev’s facilities in Bangkok and other provinces in Thailand and Myanmar.
- ThaiBev conducts safety training seminars, such as fire safety and road safety, daily safety briefings at the beginning of each working day at production plants, ISO 45001 occupational health and safety standards training, and training for safety officers in all business units.
- The company implemented a data collection and reporting system to collect safety and occupational health data in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The data is analyzed for safety performance indicators to ensure that operations are properly monitored and that corrective actions are taken in a timely manner. ThaiBev regularly reports the safety performance of each subsidiary to the product group’s senior executives.

## Occupational Health

- **Care** - ThaiBev ensures employee health by providing on-site doctors and nurses for medical treatments and health consultations. The company also has agreements with nearby hospitals to treat injured or sick employees so they can quickly and conveniently receive medical treatment any time.

# Employee Wellbeing

- **Prevention** - ThaiBev helps employees prevent illness, for instance by providing annual flu vaccinations.
- **Treatment** - ThaiBev provides support for outpatient medical expenses for employees, in addition to social security contributions that the company pays under the law. ThaiBev also provides accident insurance and inpatient illness insurance for all employees.
- **Check-ups** - ThaiBev arranges annual health checks for all employees according to gender, age and other risk factors. These include prostate and breast cancer screenings for employees in certain age groups, and an additional check-up for factory employees who have other work-related risk factors.
- **Education** - ThaiBev provides educational materials and training on healthcare and common diseases for employees and their family members, including office syndrome and stress reduction. In addition, ThaiBev provides basic life-saving skills training for employees, and a first-aid CPR AED training course.

## Working Environment

- ThaiBev expanded operations into a new building, the ThaiBev Quarter. This allowed ThaiBev to implement "Flexible Working Hours" in which employees at the new headquarters could choose their own check-in and check-out times. Flexible working hours are fully in place for more than 2,400 management staff. Further, convenient virtual working stations have been set up in multiple locations, allowing employees to complete their work without having to be present in the office. This also applies to workers below the management level. Flexible working hours are allowed for on-field employees such as sales reps, whose performance is results-oriented, to facilitate effective time management. For remaining staff, flexible working hours are supported through the time management system as long as they receive an endorsement from their supervisors.

## Employee Wellbeing

- Achieving work-family balance is part of ThaiBev’s wellbeing goals to promote employee productivity and morale. ThaiBev demonstrates this commitment by providing space or playgrounds at factories for children while they are accompanying or waiting for their parents. In addition, private breastfeeding rooms are available at all offices and production plants. ThaiBev has expanded its childcare facilities to include classes and recreational activities during school vacations. A popular family program at the company is Children’s Day, which brings together children and their parents for special activities, field trips, and CSR activities to promote spending time together. In 2021, ThaiBev granted 1,099 scholarships, valued at more than 6.93 million THB, to employees’ children to reduce their financial burdens. Over 12 consecutive years, ThaiBev has granted 12,592 scholarships totalling over 77.92 million THB.

- ThaiBev is strongly committed to its female employees, who can take up to 100 days of paid maternity leave. This is 10 days more than the legal requirement in Thailand. In some cases, new mothers may ask for an additional 30 days. ThaiBev believes these measures promote family values and foster employee health and wellbeing for both mother and child.

# 2021 Highlight

## Employee Wellbeing during COVID-19

ThaiBev prioritizes employees' health and wellbeing above all. ThaiBev also extends support to employees' families and loved ones.

# Employee Wellbeing

## With PASSION 2025 Commitment

In 2021, ThaiBev ensured that health was promoted throughout the value chain and built new capacities to prepare for future challenges. ThaiBev strengthened its current capacity to respond to potential health and safety-related risks, and showed why it was one of only six companies in Thailand to receive the “WeCare Most Caring Company” award.

## Achievements

### Target progress & timeline

- ThaiBev remains committed to a zero fatality goal. However, two employees and one contractor fatalities were recorded in 2021. As a result, ThaiBev launched an intensive root-cause analysis and tightened its safety culture, expanding OHS KPI to the whole group and implementing the OHS initiative program. This led to the enforcement of a strict automobile policy and training on OHS to ensure safety, including proper PPE equipment, daily safety talks and strict supervision for working protocols.

## COVID-19 Response

### Employee Wellbeing during COVID-19

ThaiBev cares about its employees’ health, safety and wellbeing, and this was accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. ThaiBev adopted various measures to prevent, care for, facilitate, and help employees during this time.

1. Appropriately manage workspaces, including space expansion or the relocation of employees to work in different locations to support physical distancing in the workplace.
2. Work-from-home policy for those who can work remotely to reduce infection risks for employees and their families. This group of employees is not permitted to access the office or other facilities without proper preparation to prevent the risk of infection.
3. Safety measures when entering facilities include proof of COVID-19 test, disinfection, providing alcohol gel, temperature checks and the provision of protective gear.
4. Use digital technology to record working hours and cancel the use of finger-scanning systems to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
5. Establish a COVID-19 Relief Center to provide information and advice on how to handle the situation most effectively and assist employees who are impacted by COVID-19.
6. Provide additional benefits to employees, such as free COVID-19 screening tests for over 12,000 employees and COVID-19 insurance for over 50,000 employees.
7. Distribution of protective gear, such as masks and alcohol gel, to employees and their family members, and distribution of clean drinking water to reduce risks from visiting convenience stores.

### ThaiBev Situation Room

The ThaiBev Situation Room (TSR) was created to monitor information related to COVID-19, as well as the wellbeing of all employees. TSR, in collaboration with related departments and functions, monitors and manages all risks involved and provides support to employees and their families. This can potentially be used and adapted in the future for other purposes.

# Community Support

Provide alcohol and masks to COVID-19 isolation facilities and to local governments to disperse to nearby communities.

# SDG Indicators

ThaiBev's work on safety, occupational health, and wellbeing are in line with SDGs 3, 8, and 16. Through the company's actions and initiatives, ThaiBev aims to strive towards achieving good health and wellbeing, decent work and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies.

### Goals
- **Goal 3:** Good Health and Well-Being
- **Goal 8:** Decent Work and Economic Growth
- **Goal 16:** Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

### Sub-targets
- **3.8** Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

# Towards 2025 and Beyond

1. Promote safety culture and extend activities related to occupational health and safe working environments to ThaiBev’s subsidiaries in ASEAN.
2. Target toward zero fatalities.
3. The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) in 2021 was significantly decreased from 2020,
   - Employee: from 1.71 to 1.43
   - Non-employee worker: from 1.74 to 0.69
   - This trend is in line with our goal toward achieving a LTIFR of lower than 1.0 by 2025.
4. Instill road-safety discipline among employees by organizing training and other activities to promote safety. The project will be extended to employees in other regions and business partners to reduce the driving mortality rate, which mostly involves accidents due to violations of traffic laws and lack of road safety discipline.
5. Build a network of safety officers in ThaiBev Group throughout ASEAN to increase the effectiveness of safety activities and allow more extensive communication and exchange of information. Provide advanced safety training to officers on a regular basis.
6. Work with employees to proactively administer new health guidelines. Raise awareness, encourage employees to exercise and maintain good hygiene, reduce work-related stress, and provide vaccinations against diseases that occur frequently among employees to promote a healthier life and a happier workplace.

# Human Rights

ThaiBev believes that corporations have an important role to play in human rights. They are a major focus in all of the company’s ESG initiatives and across the organization more broadly and its value chain. ThaiBev strictly protects human rights, including those of its stakeholders, and complies with national and international laws, such as the Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

This year, ThaiBev continued to uphold its strong performance on human rights within the organization and throughout the value chain. Amid growing awareness of the positive correlation between good social performance and improved business performance, other companies are increasingly focusing their efforts on addressing human rights issues. ThaiBev aims to be a best-practice leader in this regard, and works to ensure strict compliance with the contents of the company’s Human Rights Policy.

# Strategy

ThaiBev has identified key approaches for human rights management throughout the value chain. These include:

- Respect human rights by treating all business units equally.
- Proactively manage human rights issues through a dedicated human rights due diligence process.
- Be responsible and committed to ensuring that all parts of the organization respect human rights across all sectors, including those involving ThaiBev stakeholders, and to ensure that no business activities are in violation of human rights.
- Have an effective mechanism to remedy, correct, rehabilitate and compensate for the impact of any human rights violation arising from the organization’s business activities.
- Clearly communicate the company’s human rights practices to all stakeholders and provide transparent and effective channels to file complaints.
- Provide knowledge, training, and support for employees, suppliers, and customers to ensure they strictly respect the human rights of all stakeholders involved in the company’s work.

# Management Approach

## Human Rights Due Diligence Process

This program was initiated in 2017. In 2021, ThaiBev identified three important human rights risks related to stakeholders, including:

- Employee health and safety
- Employee working conditions
- Community health and safety

The next step is to hold a meeting among relevant parties to identify root causes and develop collaborative solutions, track success, and further communicate with those involved.

## Human Rights Due Diligence Process

1. Policy commitment
2. Assess actual and potential impacts (Human Rights Risk Assessment)
3. Integrate findings and potential impacts
4. Track and communicate performance
5. Remediate adverse impacts

# 1. Policy Commitment

ThaiBev is committed to respecting the human rights of all stakeholders. The company operates in line with international human rights principles and labour standards, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. ThaiBev expects all executives and employees in its businesses, including those in its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and new business relations (i.e., through mergers and acquisitions), as well as suppliers and business partners, to respect the human rights of all stakeholders to ensure that all are respected equally. Compliance with the company’s Human Rights Policy is compulsory for all stakeholders.

Key human rights aspects covered in the company’s Human Rights Policy and Statement include:

- Discrimination and harassment
- Forced labour and child labour
- Freedom of association
- Equal remuneration
- Working conditions
- Workplace safety and health

All ThaiBev stakeholders must comply with these aspects according to laws and regulations and aim to satisfy them with the highest possible standards.

## Implementation

Through its human rights due diligence process, ThaiBev regularly assesses human rights risks in all of its business activities, including direct impacts from its own operations, as well as those that ThaiBev may be involved in supporting, or have a role in supporting, in all areas of its operation. ThaiBev has established several policies and management controls to support the implementation of human rights management.

### Examples of such policies and management controls include:

- Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Policy
- Employee Code of Conduct
- Anti-Corruption Policy
- Whistleblowing Policy
- Environmental Policy
- Risk Management Policy
- Supplier Code of Practice
- Investment Guideline

Furthermore, ThaiBev tracks, monitors, and assesses its human rights risks, ensuring that its whistleblowing and complaint channels can effectively receive concerns related to potential human rights violations. Input gathered through these channels is used to create improvements, detailed in the human rights performance section of the annual sustainability report.

# 2. Assess Actual and Potential Impacts (Human Rights Risk Assessment)

ThaiBev’s human rights risk assessment covers 100% of the company’s operational sites, categorized according to business activity:

- Main business activities: Sourcing, Production, Distribution and Logistics, Marketing and Sales, and Post-consumption packaging management
- Supporting business activity: Human resources

The human rights risk assessment also covers 100% of ThaiBev’s Tier 1 suppliers.

### The Human Rights Risk Assessment Covers Actual and Potential Human Rights Issues As Follows:

- Forced labour
- Human trafficking
- Child labour
- Freedom of association
- Right to collective bargaining
- Equal remuneration
- Discrimination and harassment
- Working conditions and OHS (occupational health and safety)
- Related issues

### The Human Rights Risk Assessment Covers Employees and At-Risks/Vulnerable Groups. Vulnerable Groups Include:

- Women
- Children
- Indigenous people
- Migrant workers
- Third-party contracted labour
- Local Communities
- LGBTQI+
- Disabled people

# Human Rights Risk Assessment (Methodology)

## Human Rights Issue Identification

- Identify all human rights issues relevant to ThaiBev’s operations, value chain, and new business relations by considering their impact on the business and the potential effects on rights-holders.
- Identify affected stakeholders, including vulnerable people (i.e., women, children, indigenous people, migrant labourers, third-party contracted labour, local communities, LGBTQI+, and disabled people).

### Inherent Risk Ranking
- Ranking inherent risks (risks without controls/measures) of identified human rights issues.

### Residual Risk Ranking
- For high inherent risk, ranking residual risks (risks with existing company controls/measures).

### Risk Prioritization
- Prioritizing salient human rights issues, referring to identified human rights issues with a high residual risk.

## 3. Integrate Findings and Potential Impacts

Once human rights risks and impacts have been assessed, ThaiBev works to implement its management measures, particularly those for high-risk issues. After these measures are implemented, ThaiBev monitors and reviews the performance to ensure continuous development that maximizes efficiency.

### In 2021, ThaiBev Identified the Following 10 Salient Human Rights Issues:

In 2021, ThaiBev identified 10 salient human rights issues linked to employee health and safety, working conditions, discrimination, and community health and safety. The issues were related to four business units: distribution, marketing and sales, post-consumption packaging management, and human resources.

# Limitless Opportunities

ThaiBev believes that successful organizations work together with their employees to create personalized, authentic, and motivating experiences that ultimately strengthen both individual and company performance. Providing employees with training and advancement opportunities, and helping them address various skills gaps, are other important aspects that can strengthen ThaiBev as a company.

ThaiBev is committed to being the best possible employer and strongly believes that career satisfaction and advancement opportunities motivate employees to seek long-term commitments with the company. To foster organizational strength from within, ThaiBev promotes the concept of “oneness,” offering opportunities for employees to learn and develop new skills as they strive for success in the organization. This results in high-caliber and happy employees who want to grow with the company.

The pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital experience in career satisfaction and accelerated the integration of digital technology at work. ThaiBev employees can now work virtually from anywhere. A focus on the development of such digital technology, with the aim to enable fast and efficient work, has increased in anticipation of potential future disruptions.

# 2021 Highlight

## ThaiBev Virtual Internship and ASEAN Internship

Despite obstacles in internship programs during the "work from home" period, ThaiBev continues to believe that the young generation is an invaluable resource, knowing it will grow up to be the workforce of the future. Accordingly, it has expanded its internship program to a regional level (within ASEAN), where interns work online. It is a borderless opportunity. This not only helps strengthen the organization regionally, but also creates new training opportunities for interns.

This helps to build a strong candidate pipeline from Thailand and countries in ASEAN, while also expanding ThaiBev’s footprint in ASEAN. ThaiBev’s Virtual Internship program includes 90 participants, divided into three segments: work experience (70 percent), which features on-the-job training and mentoring; business camp and training program (20 percent), which involves virtual training and business case work; and experience stage (10 percent), which assigns a project to participants that they later present.

More than 93 percent of internship participants said they were satisfied with the program and 100 percent said they were interested in working for ThaiBev after graduation. The ASEAN internship included 40 participants: 10 from Thailand, 18 from Vietnam, three from Myanmar, and nine from Cambodia. After completing the internship, participants revealed an average satisfaction rate of 4.68 (out of 5).

Also, 100 percent of participants said they were interested in returning to the company as full-time employees. Participants experienced approximately 10 different areas of work in the company, including finance, data analysis, human capital, sales and marketing, supply chains, sustainability, and engineering.

## Talent Development Program

Determined to drive employee’s full potential and unlock the talent, ThaiBev’s Talent Development Program has been designed to support and enhance high potentials at every level. By applying the Learner Centric Principle, the company uses the 70:20:10 development model to provide learning through Action-Learning Project, Executives Sharing and Formal Classrooms to enhance business knowledge and develop leadership skill. The program we provide to our high potentials at each level starting from young generation to executive level include of Supervisory Development Program (SDP), Management Development Program (MDP), ASEAN Management Development (AMD) and Senior Executive Development Program (SEDP). With this blended learning method in all development programs, learners will get an opportunity to learn with regional leading universities and institutions. Most importantly, learners will work closely with ThaiBev executives on business projects to solve real business issues and to improve product & service that will help drive business growth.

# Career Development Ecosystem

To enhance "Limitless Opportunities" (Human Capital’s Philosophy), the Career Development Ecosystem has been established. Leveraging technology, multiple platforms are developed to integrate end-to-end career development processes to help employees access career opportunities with better experiences and make limitless career opportunities a reality. One benefit is creating an ecosystem where employees can be part of joint career development, resulting in engagement.

"My Career" is an integrated and interactive career navigation platform that helps employees assess and explore opportunities within ThaiBev Group and design their career paths.

The platform assists employees by navigating opportunities and recommended positions. ThaiBev uses technology to suggest career opportunities by logical requirements. It features over 1,400 standardized job roles and predefined career paths to recommend potential career paths and job opportunities. Employees can initially assess their capabilities for each position following over 200 functional competencies based on the job family embedded in the platform.

The company encourages employees to take ownership of their self-development with support from supervisors by using Individual Development Plans (IDP). The IDP is expanded for all job levels, allowing employees to develop plans through the Bevareset System and select learning solutions. Employees can manage ongoing plans and complete plans independently.

The "Career Dashboard" offers line managers and HRBP real-time data on employees' careers, including promotion eligibility forecasts and historical statistics on promotion and rotation. It also displays IDP tracking progress so managers and HRBP can track and monitor employees' IDP planning and execution.

"Career Profile" provides line managers with a resourceful employee professional profile and career journey. It serves as a centralized source of internal candidate information, enabling HR recruitment teams and hiring managers to facilitate more efficient internal hiring processes.

# With PASSION 2025 Commitment

To meet the requirements of Passion2025, ThaiBev initiated the "Transformation" Program as a way to develop a global talent pool for the organization. The aim is to help ThaiBev achieve its organizational goals by 2025 and beyond by building, unlocking, and strengthening employee capabilities amid rapidly changing business needs.

Presently, the "Transformation" Program consists of more than 40 sub-projects. One of these sub-projects, "Future Skills Development," aims to develop human capabilities to prepare for the future. The Future Skills Development project aims to prepare the organization for the future by turning employee knowledge into skills. Future Skills are important skills that employees require to drive the organization forward.

## Steps in Future Skills Development

1. **Step 1: Future Skill Identification**
2. **Step 2: Future Skill Assessment**
3. **Step 3: Future Skill Development with RUN model (Reskill, Upskill, New Skill)**

Employees in this program apply the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) to identify skills the organization needs. The aim is to make employees ready to adapt to changes and increase the organization’s capacity for sustainable growth.

It aims to promote an inclusive growth mindset, including a belief in one’s own potential and dedication for continuous self-improvement. It strives to make employees open to change and fosters among them an inclination to grow together. It also develops their ability to communicate and understand the needs of related parties and collaborate with others to achieve common organizational goals. It also promotes critical and analytical thinking, digital literacy as well as language and culture.

Step two involves a future skill assessment centered on the future skill levels of employees to identify areas for improvement.

Finally, under future skills development, employees gain a better understanding of the RUN Model. As they reskill, they develop a new set of skills for different jobs, such as changing from being on-trade salespersons to being TT salespersons. As they upskill, they develop additional skills to do the same job with increased efficiency. For instance, they try to increase sales skills to achieve sales goals. Finally, under new skills, they develop a completely new set of skills to work in a new job. For instance, they switch from being a salesperson to being an agent.

The pilot program focused on the sales team. The Key Account Management program (KAM) also consists of future skills development. Program participants include those in assistant manager positions and above, totaling more than 100 people. The program started with a skills assessment and periodically evaluated participants’ progress. Examples of educational development, on-the-job training, and training results are reflected in business achievements. The company is currently monitoring KAM activities, such as weekly sales reports, Morning Talk, and call plans to identify areas for improvement.

# Consumer Health and Safety

Consumer health and safety is one of ThaiBev’s top priorities and has a significant impact and influence on stakeholders. ThaiBev recognizes the importance of producing quality, safe and healthy foods and beverages from ethically sourced, high-quality ingredients. The company sets rigid standards and closely monitors all of its operations to ensure consistent quality and safety throughout production, storage, transportation, and other aspects of service. These efforts have also led the company to adopt international standards, such as ISO 22000, NSF, and GMP/HACCP. By emphasizing consumer health and safety, ThaiBev seeks to continually strengthen consumer and stakeholder trust.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2020

The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted some consumer focus towards the health and safety of products. It has brought about a new understanding of the effect of people's consumption habits on their strength and immunity to fight off viruses and other health ailments. A general trend towards healthy lifestyles has been further solidified. Health issues remain a significant challenge for the world today. According to the World Health Organization, a majority of deaths may be caused by non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, vascular disease, heart disease, and cancer. It is estimated that chronic non-communicable diseases cause 75% of all Thai deaths, of which 55% occur in people under 70 years of age. These factors are leading to a shift in the way consumers view health and safety in their purchases.

ThaiBev continues to research and develop new foods and beverages to expand its range of healthy and delicious product offerings.

The R&D Center focuses on the following health & nutrition areas:
1. Low sugar content, ThaiBev collaborated with suppliers in developing healthier sugar substitutes and natural sweeteners without affecting original taste and obtain the “Healthier Choice Logo” from Mahidol University.
2. Low sodium content, control and reduce sodium.
3. Increased nutritious ingredients, vitamin added in products.
4. No Mono Sodium Glutamate in OISHI packaged ramen products.
5. No preservative in OISHI Gyoza.
6. Organic raw material, ThaiBev collaborated with suppliers in sourcing quality organic raw materials and ingredients.
7. Nutrition facts on labelling including calories, sugar, fat, sodium, and more. This is applied for all of its products for communication channel with customer.

To promote ThaiBev’s strategic approach to health and nutrition, the company has created a policy statement, an advisory panel and R&D centers, and defined “healthy nutrition” criteria for its products.

## Management Approach

ThaiBev remains committed to developing healthy, nutritious, and safe products. Its research and development teams are set up specifically to develop healthy and nutritious products. The company also collaborates with external agencies, such as universities and business partners, to research and develop products that are healthier for consumers. Research focuses on certain nutritional aspects, such as developing products with less sugar, sodium, fat, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and preservatives, as well as added nutrition. ThaiBev also recognizes the importance of disclosing nutritional information to its consumers through various channels, investing in research and development, and aligning its production with international standards.

## 2021 Highlight

**V-Boost Vitamin C Drink:** In 2021, ThaiBev launched a new health product under the brand “V-Boost.” This drink features 200 percent of the required daily value (DV) of vitamin C. The drink also contains beta-glucan from the United States, which contributes to the normal functioning of white blood cells and the immune system. Because V-Boost is low-sugar, with only 30 kilocalories (kcal) per serving, it has earned the “Healthier Choice” nutritional logo by the Institute of Nutrition of Mahidol University. V-Boost is available in two flavours: orange and lemon.

**OISHI Gold Wakoucha:** OISHI Gold Wakoucha is a Japanese tea made from selected, naturally fermented guang tea leaves.

# Delivery Services During COVID-19

The online market significantly expanded during COVID-19 due to rapidly changing consumer behaviour. With e-commerce, including delivery services, playing a more important role in consumers' lives, business strategies must adapt to increase sales. The following are business strategies and activities undertaken by ThaiBev:

## Channel Strategy

Generate sales through online channels managed under brands' own platforms and through business partners' services.

- Set competitive prices and participate in promotional activities.
- Enter the e-marketplace through online-to-offline (O2O) commerce to reach target groups via e-vouchers.

## Omnichannel Strategy

Drive marketing and sales with the restaurant as the center location. Consumers can shop online and specify a branch or pickup point, including the date and time they would like to receive their products.

- Allow for self-pickup (SPU) at all branches that provide home delivery services.
- Allow for curbside pickup services. Customers can pick up their products without getting out of their vehicles.

## Service Expansion Strategy

- Expand food menus for existing in-store kitchens under the name "OISHI Kitchen." This will provide increased sales opportunities for brands without a store in the area.
- Expand service areas in certain branches without affecting food quality.
- Collaborate with local service providers to provide another channel for sales and delivery.

## Contactless Strategy

- Increase channels for contactless payments.
- Contactless delivery of clean, safe food in compliance with social distancing measures.

The system collects data from real services to maintain a customer base, offering personalized marketing such as special privileges and e-coupons through push notifications to BevFood application members. Messages can be sent to all members or specific groups, including terms and duration of promotional use. A system tracks feedback from promotional activities to develop future activities and increase customer satisfaction.

  - Non-Repeating: 495,584 members (1 Oct 2020 – 7 Sep 2021)

## Online Customer Relationship Management

The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of digital media. Business partners have grown more familiar with online channels to boost sales and trade relations. Consumers now span a wide range of age groups. Digital media is crucial for daily communication and as a sales channel. The company developed an online platform for traders and consumers. For example, Chang Mineral Natural Still Water created content related to new generation lifestyles on its "Chang World" Facebook page, focusing on music, football, and food. OISHI Green Tea continues its "digital proactive" marketing strategy, engaging young people with modern lifestyles.

OISHI Green Tea also developed the OISHI Club application, with approximately 400,000 members. It offers exclusive activities, privileges, and prizes to build brand loyalty and strong customer relationships.

# OISHI Facebook

Currently, OISHI's Facebook (www.facebook.com/OISHIDrinkStation) has 4.6 million followers. Last year, its brand content reached 98 million people.

In addition to successfully connecting with its consumers through online channels, the company also has the Sermsuk Family application to connect with its business partners.

# Sermsuk Family Application

The company developed the Sermsuk Family application to help its business partners generate more sales. Business partners, not only customers, are becoming more familiar with digital lifestyles. They want simple, no-hassle, and fast ways to participate in the company's various promotional activities. The Sermsuk company, a distributor of beverage products, including Crystal, est, and OISHI, has developed "Sermsuk Family," a LINE application that provides customer and product information and allows business partners to participate in activities and collect points to redeem rewards. This application has received excellent feedback from participating stores. Presently, there are more than 60,000 stores in the Sermsuk Family. In order to facilitate better internal communication between customers and the company's sales staff, the company has also developed "Sermsuk Camp," another LINE application. Sermsuk Camp includes communications and lists of activities that customers are participating in, enabling all to be on the same page and increasing customer satisfaction.

# With PASSION 2025 Commitment

In navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and helping customers address the situation through various activities, ThaiBev has bolstered customers’ confidence. ThaiBev continues to build and strengthen its relations with customers as well as sales agents—ThaiBev’s main stakeholders.

ThaiBev helped customers address this situation through the following activities: it created videos to provide knowledge on health and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and it provided COVID-19 insurance, alcohol, masks, ATK test kits, and more.

Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery unit of Sermsuk Public Company Limited provided delivery services to consumer premises in Bangkok and the vicinity as the government ordered citizens to self-quarantine at home. Customers were able to purchase various products, including Crystal Drinking Water, est Cola, and OISHI Green Tea.

ThaiBev has adopted the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), in line with the initiatives of His Late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the first royal command by His Majesty King Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun to “Continue, Sustain and Develop”, as a guideline in business management. This has driven the organization towards sustainability, in tandem with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). The company has also incorporated an ESG framework - environmental responsibility, a network of business alliances in all sectors throughout the value chain (Social), along with good governance principles and the company’s code of conduct – as an important strategy to drive operations and help society. In this regard, the focus is on five key pillars: education, public health, sports, arts and culture, and community development. This approach has enabled us to build on successful results by establishing good relationships with all stakeholders, with the goal of becoming a stable and sustainable leader in ASEAN’s food and beverage sector.

ThaiBev has also been a key driver in collaborative efforts between different sectors, including the government, private sector, academic sector, civil society sector, and the public. One of the highlight achievements has been the establishment of Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co. Ltd., the central company of the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network, which operates in 76 provinces across Thailand with the aims of generating income for communities and making people happy.

Pracharath Rak Samakkee activities are carried out under three categories: Agriculture, Added-value Produce, and Community-based Tourism. Since its founding, more than 1,353 projects have been initiated, covering 4,222 communities (99,828 households) and generating more than 1.6 billion baht in income.

Moreover, ThaiBev was the originator of a number of other highly successful projects, including the Power of Thai Foundation, Foundation for the Institute of Social Enterprise Development Thailand (FINSEDT), and Thailand Supply Chain Network (TSCN).

As a DJSI World Leader, ThaiBev initiated the Thailand Sustainability Expo (TSX) for the first time in 2020 under the concept of “Sufficiency for Sustainability”. To reinforce Thailand’s first great collaboration platform for sustainable development, the Expo was held for a second consecutive year in 2021.

During the two-year COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy and ordinary people’s livelihoods have been affected, and businesses have adjusted their strategies to the New Normal era while helping each other. ThaiBev has placed importance on helping society and its business partners in all sectors along the value chain to get through the COVID-19 situation together. The organization has coordinated assistance to public health agencies and medical personnel across the country, as well as providing a group insurance policy for COVID-19 protection to medical personnel, employees, business partners, and agents across the country. The company has also sponsored medical equipment, vaccine storage freezers, drinking water, and food.

# Education Development

Believing that education is the key to unlimited opportunities, ThaiBev has continued to implement educational development projects at all levels. ThaiBev provides scholarships to employees’ children, promoting extracurricular learning and focusing on learning through direct experience, in order to develop their career skills, life skills, and moral skills. University students have the opportunity to participate in internships, and are encouraged to study, do the household account books, read, and exchange opinions through forums, discussions, and speech contests. This not only gives students the skills needed for living a sustainable life, but also helps develop thinking, analysis, and survival skills, all of which are important foundations for children to live a meaningful and valuable life. It helps in driving the country towards sustainable development.

# 2021 Highlight

## Scholarship Fund for Children of Employees

This fund is granted to the recipients whose father or mother is an employee of ThaiBev. Since the start of the project in 2010, there have been 11,492 scholarships, totaling 77,919,000 THB.

- In the past year, 1,138 scholarships, totaling 6,907,000 THB, have been awarded to 780 primary school students, 2,484 secondary school students, 2,484 high school and vocational school students, 298 high vocational school students, 699 undergraduate scholarships, and 108 White Elephant scholarships for outstanding students.
- At present, 43 of the employees’ children who previously received the scholarships are now working for ThaiBev.

## Leadership for Sustainable Education Development Project: Connext ED

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on education. Schools and other educational institutions have had to adapt their methods to online teaching. Students have to study through the internet, but the limitations of technology, internet access, and equipment have decreased learning efficiency. This is because most kids under Connext ED Program come from poor families. Some live with grandparents who cannot help the children with their online studies, some families lack the funds to buy equipment, some parents have not been able to earn money during the pandemic. Incomes have declined while expenses have risen, greatly affecting the liquidity of families. To help mitigate the problems, ThaiBev has supported 263 Opportunity Expansion Schools under the Connext ED project in order to expand the opportunities for deprived students.

In the midst of the crisis, ThaiBev has seen good results from Connext ED. The project focuses on enhancing knowledge of financial discipline in household accounting. It helps children create the habit of saving, and teaches them the fundamentals of business to enhance their career skills. The teaching content covers business planning, marketing, and profit/loss accounting. ThaiBev also provides seed capital to children so they can practice through entrepreneurial projects. The children have to rely on themselves and learn professional skills, which they can apply in their lives. This helps lighten the burden on families and see them through the crisis. ThaiBev is confident that these skills will be carried with the children, enabling them to learn how to survive, be self-reliant, and adapt to changing situations wisely and promptly.

- More than **13,000** students participated in the entrepreneurial project, more than **18,000** in the household accounting project.
- The schools generated income of more than **2.2** million THB.

Head of Nongkhacotwipitthayakom School Weaving Group

At first, I couldn’t see what the participants would receive from this project. But as the project progressed, it has made me see that my granddaughters, Nong Phet and Nong Ploy, have learned and developed professional skills. It encourages them to know how to spend time usefully, as they can earn money themselves. The teachers asked the children to show their work on various occasions. I am very happy to see Nong Phet and Nong Ploy are getting such a great opportunity, and I deeply hope that what my grandchildren have learned and gained from the Connex ED project, will be a good foundation of professional skills to develop their future careers.

I have to say that the start of the project was a failure, because in the first two years we did not achieve our goals and gave up participating. But when I saw that the activities of other schools in the project were succeeding, I told myself, ‘If other schools can do it, why can’t we?’ It made me determined to try again. After analyzing the problems of the first two years, we found that we needed specialist knowledge, the participation of local scholars and communities, more continuity in our activities, and most importantly, a sense of community identity. In the third year, I invented a new food product, “Khao Taen Nam Yoi” (rice crackers with chili dip), about which we learned from knowledgeable people in the community. The students are allowed to do something practical, which is very successful. We have received many awards and, most importantly, we have enabled students, teachers, and the school to participate in conservation, as well as promoting tourism in Phrae.

## OTOP Junior Contest

Because of the COVID-19 situation, the OTOP Junior Contest this year could only be held at the national level and only the first round. The clubs that qualified for the final round were unable to travel to compete at the Impact Arena Muang Thong Thani, Bangkok, as in previous years. A total of 348 clubs from 317 schools in 56 provinces across the country submitted their work in the first round.

However, ThaiBev, together with the Office for the Promotion of Local Wisdom and the Community Development Department, are developing a pilot project to promote OTOP Junior products to the world. The aim is for young people who have participated in the OTOP Junior Contest to apply for the project, in order to develop their product development skills to meet market demand, while at the same time increasing their marketing channels. This activity for a young generation of entrepreneurs is consistent with the government’s policy of creating opportunities, building careers, and generating stable incomes. ThaiBev is happy to support and encourage young people in preserving and inheriting local wisdom, as well as in developing careers, creating jobs, and generating income. It’s hoped that these youngsters will develop into a valuable new generation of OTOP entrepreneurs.

100% Earthworm Castings Products, Tha Rae Suksa School, Sakon Nakhon Province, won the first prize in the OTOP Junior Contest 2018. We have passed on and developed the project from generation to generation. The product also managed to earn a sustainability award for young entrepreneurs. Having participated in the activities of OTOP City 2018-2019, I have gained experience from some of the older members of Young OTOP. We, therefore, plan to further develop our eco-friendly product in 2021, creating pride in ourselves, school, families, and communities.

Producing pellets from earthworm castings is one of the learning activities that the school offers to students, in which they can do every step by themselves from scratch. The pellets have received quality certification as compost (Grade 1) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, which is reassuring to our customers. Shops and farms have bought, used, and sold the product, helping to generate income for our students, who receive 10 THB per kilogram. It also helps to develop their business skills and enhance their experience, which they can apply in their own careers in the future.

### Partnership School Project

Now entering its fourth year, the Partnership School Project is in accordance with the Ministry of Education’s policy to raise the quality of education for Thai children, and the Thailand 4.0 policy, which will help the nation compete on the world stage. It allows the private and civil society sectors to participate in the management of educational institutions, by applying their knowledge, expertise, and versatility in working with school boards. To this end, 17 high-level executives from ThaiBev have volunteered to act as School Sponsors, working closely with personnel at 24 schools in 18 provinces to plan the schools’ development, in accordance with the context of each school. The plan emphasizes the development of vocational skills, life skills, and moral skills, as well as fulfilling educational potential, which links in with the sufficiency economy philosophy and strengthening family institutions. Although students have to learn online at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been able to apply their knowledge from the project to generate income and gain benefits from their free time.

### Teak and Teak Products Project for Students of the Partnership School in Phrae Province

**Miss Araya**  
Lower Secondary, Ban Kat Prachanukroh School, Phrae Province

Before joining the project, I had no knowledge or interest in teak at all, even though Phrae, where I live, is a land of teak. But after joining the project, it has made me see the value of teak and the importance of traditional occupations in the community. It is unbelievable that just a single tree can involve such varied knowledge, whether it is about cultivation, conservation, woodwork design or woodwork production, which all help to get the maximum benefit out of teak.

During the COVID situation, I study almost everything online. So I’m taking this opportunity to apply the knowledge I’ve gained. I have continued to make woodwork pieces, chairs and tables for family use, keychains and phone holders, which I sell through many online channels. I can earn extra income and make good use of my free time.

When students join the project, they can gain a better understanding of nature and an appreciation of teak. They realize the importance of preserving local wisdom in furniture making. They develop their skill at designing and making pieces from teak wood. It is important to nurture your own career: from my point of view, I have applied my knowledge from the teak curriculum to working on the school’s botanical garden and linking it to the school’s learning activities.

## Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project

The Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project has been supported by ThaiBev to promote self-reliant careers and income generation. Activities for students and communities around the schools involve learning life skills and academic principles by adapting the sufficiency economy philosophy. The lunch project and skills projects such as hair cutting, sewing, making bamboo furniture, and weaving have generated extra income for schools and households. There is also a project to check dams that promotes environmental awareness and the utilization of valuable resources.

# Insights

This budgetary support has enabled our school to create good activities, which promote jobs for learners to earn income during their studies. We encourage students who are not good at academics but interested in cutting hair to join the activity, as vocational education. Personally, I have gained expertise and participated in the activity in the barber shop, to help students learn and gain professional skills. In this way, they can expand their knowledge, share it with the community, and be a good person in society.

# Creating a New Generation of Socially Conscious Entrepreneurs: Beta Young Entrepreneur Project

This project originated in cooperation between the Thai Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade Thailand, The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, and the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation. It aims to nurture young people to become capable and socially responsible entrepreneurs, through activities that help develop business potential in real business trials.

- **Business potential development activities** such as start-up activities and simulation companies, which have focused on allowing students to sell more products through online channels during the COVID-19 situation. ThaiBev has also brought in personnel with knowledge and expertise in various fields, to convey their experiences in sustainable procurement, market management, and legal matters related to entrepreneurship.

- **Creative Young Designer Projects and Art Projects**, in which students help to develop more interesting community products, and share their knowledge of distribution channels and community businesses.

- **Social activities**, in order to instill business morality and ethics by learning to give back to society, such as Beta Young, ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold, the River Festival canal-cleaning activity, and sharing the profits from businesses to carry out CSR activities.

Creating a New Generation of Socially Conscious Entrepreneurs is determined to develop activities for students to practice their entrepreneurial skills, as well as cultivating ethical awareness among the young generation who will be an important force in the country's future.

## Insights

On the day I joined the project, I thought that I would be able to fulfill my dream of becoming a businessman in the future. During those four years in the project, I had the opportunity to do real business, gained experience and knowledge, and could generate income from the simulation company. I used the profits as capital after my graduation. I have now had this business for three years, with total sales of nearly 90 million THB. If I had not had the opportunity to join this project, it would have taken me longer to learn the business. So, I would like to thank ThaiBev for their advice and knowledge, which I've used to develop my own business.

## Summary of Overall Performance

- So far, seven groups of students have graduated from the program, totaling 179 people, while three groups still studying at university, totaling 55 students.

- Three-quarters of students who have graduated from the program have applied the knowledge and experience gained to their own business or in continuing a family business. The remaining quarter have found work in leading companies, including companies in the ThaiBev group.

# Education Institute Support Activity (eisa)

Recognizing the importance of the young generation, ThaiBev created and developed the eisa (Education Institute Support Activity) project to support activities in universities.

1. Supporting sports in higher education
2. Promoting practical curricula
3. Supporting student activities such as camp events

At present, the eisa project is cooperating with 42 universities in all regions of the country. The change in education styles in the modern era has created more opportunities to access teaching faculties and build stronger relationships. So far, the eisa project has networked with 92 varied faculties. This increasing number of collaborations has also helped to drive supporting activities in economic development projects. A concrete example is “Creative Young Designer Season 1”, part of the Pakaoma project, in which the Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise aims to develop a basic economic system in Pakaoma-making communities. The eisa project has collaborated with six educational institutions - Thammasat University, Rangsit University, Bangkok University, Dhurakij Pundit University, Pohchang College Rajamangala University of Technology Rattanakosin, and Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University - in order to bring a total of 338 students from their faculties of design to help diversify the products of seven Pakaoma-making communities. Four leading football clubs in Thailand - Police Tero FC, Sukhothai FC, Suphanburi FC, and Ratchaburi Mitr Phol FC - are also cooperating in popularizing Pakaoma products, by giving the products away as souvenirs, which will help build more distribution channels and generate income. This will enable the communities to become sustainable in terms of self-dependence.

In addition to promoting outside-classroom learning, the eisa project supports and promotes sports events as one of its main missions. This included being the main sponsor of the 7th Higher Education Football Competition, University Tournament 2020, organized by King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok, which is one of the largest tertiary-level football competitions in Thailand.

With a total of 24 universities and 720 athletes competing, it provided a platform for competition and training in order to develop future professional football players. This project also allowed ThaiBev to bring in its Crystal Drinking Water as the main water product for distribution within King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok, where there are more than 25,000 students and employees as potential buyers.

# Insights

The Pakaoma project helps increase income to the community and expand cooperation in order to make the designs more diverse and sustainable. The project is a collaboration between seven communities, six universities, and four football clubs to help support Pakaoma diversity.

# Transferring Knowledge, Creating Happiness: The Happy Read Project

ThaiBev, in collaboration with Amarin Printing and Publishing Public Company Limited, and supported by the Ministry of Education and a network of partners in both the public and private sectors, has set up this project to build a good reading foundation for the educational development of Thai children. It has been in operation since 2018, with 160 schools participated and has covered all 77 provinces of Thailand, as targeted. All in all, books have reached 119,833 students, of whom 19,124 have become reading club members. In 2020, students participating in the program had a 75% improvement in academic performance, calculated from the average results for Semester 1 of academic year 2020, compared to Semester 2 of academic year 2019.

In 2020, 51 schools received 1,000 donated books, 3 sets of bookshelves and 100 reading notebooks per school. The project organized a “Reading for 15 Minutes a Day” activity and established a “Book Lovers” club, in which members would record their readings in a notebook. An activity to show how fairy tales can stimulate creativity was also organized for students in the schools. News on the project can be found on the Facebook page, “The Happy Read”.

### Primary and Secondary Education

ThaiBev aims to improve students’ vocational skills and life skills, focusing on providing learning opportunities based on real experiences. This involves ThaiBev personnel or experts from various networks sharing their experiences, such as local craftspeople, successful entrepreneurs, university personnel, music teachers from the Luang Pradit Phairoh Foundation (Sorn Silapabanleng) or professional footballers from famous clubs. There are also platforms for students to show their talents, exchange opinions, and keep up with the latest developments in the world around. The projects instill morality, social responsibility, sportsmanship, and teamwork within the community. These skills are not only a foundation for young people in their education, but also a learning experience in analytical thinking and problem-solving. And most importantly, children can apply their knowledge in practice, whether in further education or their future careers.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a serious impact and create economic and social challenges for all sectors at all levels. ThaiBev believes that young people can apply their knowledge and skills to adapt and cope with change in such crisis situations.

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of education. It’s a challenge that cannot be met by any one organization or agency, but requires cooperation among all sectors. Therefore, ThaiBev not only draws on the talents of personnel within the organization, but also joins forces with network organizations in bringing people with experience, knowledge, and success to share with educational institutions. ThaiBev has linked its work on education with its social responsibility projects in four other areas: public health, sports, arts and culture, and social development. ThaiBev’s projects are being implemented in order to create tangible changes.

# Public Health Development

Recognizing the importance of public health to national development, ThaiBev has continued to promote public health in the community by supporting the activities of a wide range of health organizations, foundations, and agencies. The objective is for people to have good health, by knowing about disease prevention and how to take care of their own well-being, in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on good health and well-being.

# Athletic Development

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of football projects has had to change as follows, in order to ensure the safety of the participants:

- Providing theoretical and practical knowledge of the situation through online channels to comply with the government’s public health guidelines
- Restricting the number of participants in each area of the project, in accordance with the latest announcements from The Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA)
- Increasing safety measures such as temperature checks and ATK tests
- Collaborating with partners in the sports industry in getting tested for COVID-19 at ThaiBev’s COVID Center.

## ThaiBev Football Academy

Entering its 12th year of operation, this youth football skills training program is free of charge. It has continued to operate during the pandemic by following the government’s preventive measures against COVID-19. ThaiBev attaches great importance to maintaining football development alongside public safety by increasing health and sanitation measures and adjusting training methods to suit the situation.

## Chang Mobile Football Clinic

This is the 8th year of the Chang Mobile Football Clinic project, which provides football training opportunities to young people in remote areas. It has become a model for youth football clinics across the country. The goal is to implement the project thoroughly in all 76 provinces of Thailand in order to build a solid foundation, and to help fulfill the dreams of Thai youths who want to become professional footballers. Despite the spread of COVID-19, the efficiency of the project has been maintained by adjusting its implementation guidelines.

## Chang Soccer School and Assumption College Thonburi’s White Elephant Project

ThaiBev has partnered with Assumption College Thonburi in “Chang Soccer Project” to select talented 10-year-old footballers from all regions of the country to receive “White Elephant” scholarships. The scholarship provides free educational support and football skills coaching up to Grade 12. In 2021, more than 5,000 young people participated in the project, which is effective at producing quality players. More than 200 well-known professional footballers in Thailand have come out of the programs in the past 10 years.

# Golf

Golf is one of the sports that ThaiBev believes in helping develop quality personnel into Thai society, since it is a sport that requires mental control and dexterity. For over 10 years, it has had a clear step-by-step development system, with 3 major projects.

| ThaiBev Golf Projects                  | Objectives                                                                 | Successes in 2021                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Chang Thailand Junior Golf Circuit  | Youth golf tournaments in various age groups to build experience and strong foundation | Approximately 1,000 golfers have been participating in the tournament each year, a figure that’s likely to increase in future years (in 2021, there was no tournament due to COVID-19). |
| 2. Chang Thailand Junior Golf Clinic   | Coaching in golf techniques for young golfers who have been selected from the Golf Circuit by world-class golf pros | This is recognized as an effective project by the golfers who have participated (in 2021, there was no clinic due to Covid-19). |

Ten of them are among the country’s top-ranked golfers, and three compete on the Asian Tour. |

## Thai Talent Golfers

Golf is one professional sport in which Thais have built a world-class reputation. Among many development projects, ThaiBev’s Thai Talent Golfers program aims to spot the ability of young Thai golfers who have the potential to go global if actively promoted. Over the past 10 years, 25 golfers have received support under the brand, in order to practice and compete domestically and internationally. The three main philosophies of the program are "Talent, Goodness, Heroism". 15 golfers have successfully turned professional, 10 of them are among the country’s top-ranked golfers, and three compete in the Asian Tour.

## Figure Skate & Speed Skating

For 9 years, ThaiBev has granted sponsorships for figure skating, an international sport full of both challenges and beauty that is becoming more and more popular among young Thais. The athletes have exceeded expectations by achieving outstanding performances at the ASEAN, Asian and global levels. ThaiBev is continuously looking forward to providing development support in this sport to gain further international success.

# Basketball

ThaiBev has supported basketball in Thailand for more than 9 years. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the basketball teams have continued to achieve results in many national championship tournaments, and some of the athletes have attracted the attention of foreign league basketball clubs. ThaiBev will continue to support basketball, in order to develop athletes with strength, precision, and speed who could become international-calibre basketball players.

# Achievements

The various sports projects that ThaiBev supports have continued to be successful each year, and have contributed to the sustainable development of the sports industry in Thailand.

| ThaiBev Sport Projects | Objectives | Successes in 2021 |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Youth football         | All youth football projects will continue to operate and constantly improve their guidelines to meet international standards, as well as implementing public health measures throughout the current COVID-19 situation. | Before the COVID-19 situation, youth football projects were a proud success. 70% of those who participate in the program regularly are in good health and have the right football skills that can be leveraged into further success, while remaining close to their families, which is a good foundation for Thai society. The COVID-19 situation has caused the projects to stop from time to time. Because of that, project implementation has been temporarily suspended but ThaiBev is still collaborating with partners and volunteers (parents/teachers/local leaders). |

# Insights

## Somporn Chaibangyang

Former Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Interior, currently serving as the President of the Volleyball Association of Thailand for the fifth time, after 30 years of involvement with the association. He is recognized among member clubs, athletes, coaches, referees, and people involved in the industry as a person who is dedicated to the Thai sports industry, especially volleyball.

The key achievement in ThaiBev’s sporting operations is building a strong, collaborative network in operations, development, and problem-solving, as well as developing and promoting athletes as good role models for Thai society.

When volleyball was still unknown and not as popular as it is today, there was no support. But ThaiBev stepped in and befriended us, fighting together with us from the very beginning. It has been 30 years now and I can say with pride that ThaiBev has played an important part in the development of the Thai volleyball program.

I would like all kinds of sports, not just volleyball, to be viewed as creating opportunities for young people’s development across the country, so that they achieve success in sports, education and their future careers... and I hope that young people will learn that sport teaches them to be kind, to know how to lose, how to win, how to forgive and how to be part of a team with love and unity. This will lead to yet further progress and success for the Thai volleyball industry.

## Rangsan Wiwatchaichoke

"Coach Aon" is a former national team player and professional footballer for many clubs in the Thai League. Smart, unflappable and with an outstanding leadership character, he was often named team captain during his 20-year playing career. He managed to win five Thai League championships, earning himself the nickname “Mr. Thai League.” Now 42, he is the head coach of Police Tero in Thai League 1.

Football has been a major part of my life because on the day I became a footballer, what I gained was education, learning, and experience that cannot be found anywhere else. And I also have a career that I love. I have learned to live with other people, to earn respect as a leader, and to have a broader perspective.

In my coaching career, I have been given this opportunity by the executives and the team. I realize that duties and technical responsibilities are important. But what’s even more important is that everyone is committed to the team and always feels that the team is their home, so they must do their best to protect our home, our family.

Sportsmanship is something I have always learned since I became a footballer, because in addition to making the game more attractive, it makes the audience aware of the fairness, ethics, and spirit of the athletes. It is important to pass on sportsmanship to other team members and the opponents, to make the atmosphere more fun regardless of the outcome of the match.

With great support from ThaiBev, I have had the opportunity to work with many projects. It is important for the development of sports in our country. I would like to give thanks to ThaiBev and hope that ThaiBev will continue to stand alongside the Thai sports industry.

# COVID-19 Response

During the COVID-19 pandemic, professional sports and other sports-related activities have encountered major challenges, ranging from cancellations and postponements to changes in competition management. The "New Normal" way involved athletes training at home named "Training of Home" to build their physical fitness to be ready for competition. Later on, they were allowed to practice as a team in a closed environment, as long as there were strict healthcare measures in accordance with CCSA regulations. In addition, communication channels have completely changed, causing the model of operations and public relations to change.

1. **Publishing information on sports through online media**  
   To build cooperation and learn new athletic techniques. To create wider awareness and understanding, Thai Talent Facebook put out programs with knowledgeable and entertaining activities and talks, such as: "Ask and Answer" and "Thai Talent Talk."

2. **Organizing sporting events and competitions**  
   In a closed environment according to the government's public health measures, which regularly change to keep up with the situation. Safety measures, such as temperature checks and ATK tests for COVID, have also been implemented.

3. **Collaborating with partners in the sports industry**  
   To arrange testing for COVID-19 at ThaiBev’s COVID Center.

Such collaborations between ThaiBev and its partners in the sports industry have always been well organized, in order to create a pathway for the development of national sports together, no matter what may arise.

# Preservation of National Arts and Culture

The preservation of artistic and cultural heritage is important in Thailand. In order to pass on the country’s virtuous artistic and cultural traditions to future generations, ThaiBev attaches great importance to their preservation, development, and promotion. The goal is to bring Thainess to the world, and at the same time, it creates stable and sustainable values for Thai society.

# 2021 Highlight

The first approach is to pass on national’s arts, culture, and traditions for the purposes of dissemination, study, and learning, by focusing on maintaining their essential core. ThaiBev supports agencies and individuals in upholding Thai and international arts and culture.

The second approach is to sustain and preserve Thai arts, culture, and identity for the next generation, by maintaining historic sites, artifacts, national artists, historical material, and traditions.

The third approach is to enhance fields of knowledge concerning arts and culture, as provided by relevant professional organizations or individuals with expertise and skills to provide opportunities for capacity development. Hand in hand with this is a plan to establish and support new activities in collaboration with other stakeholders.

All 3 approaches feed into the goals of “Bringing Thainess to the World” and “Creating Values for a Stable and Sustainable Society”.

The following four methods are used, depending on conditions and factors both inside and outside the organization: creation of new projects/activities (Innovation); supporting the operations of outside organizations (Sponsorship); co-creation with partners (Collaboration); network management in arts and culture (Partnership).

ThaiBev divides these works into 4 fields: Visual Arts, Music and Literary Arts, Culture and Traditions, and Buddhism.

# Culture and Traditions

## Bangkok Water Festival 2021

This project has been reinforcing the strategy of “Bowon”, in cooperation among houses, temples, schools, companies, social enterprises, and government agencies, in order to create community sustainability and a good environment for a good quality of life. It aims to promote “Sufficiency for the Community, Sustainability for the World” through the “Bring Back – Recycle” project, an activity that gives communities an opportunity to think, collaborate, develop and take action on sustainable waste management.

The “Bring Back – Recycle” project by Thai Beverage Recycle Company Limited (TBR), in conjunction with the “Water Way, Thai Way” Festival, provided a workshop titled, “Sufficiency for the Community, Sustainability for the World”, in order to promote sustainability in its environmental and cultural dimensions. Houses, temples, and schools were cleaned, and there was a training program on “Young People Inherit the Culture”, focusing on community participation in environmental management, with an emphasis on cultivating awareness among young people. They learnt how to separate trash at source and prepare it properly for the recycling process, so reducing the amount of waste. The community participated in a systematic management plan with the private and education sectors.

The youth and pilot communities who took part in this activity came from Thonburi, Bangkok, from Mai Khao in Phuket Province, and from Lamphun Municipality. In addition, unity was fostered by making trash bins that reflected the identity of each community, such as the starfish-shaped PET plastic bottle sorting bin that was made from scrap fishing nets, by the fishing community of Village No. 4, Ban Mai Khao, Phuket Province. An elephant-shaped PET bottle sorting bin, made of bamboo by Chiang Mai craftsmen, was displayed at Kad Ba Pao, Chiang Mai Province.

*The “Bring Back – Recycle” project is a community development activity that gives the community an opportunity to think, develop, and take action on waste management. It is a continuation of the Bangkok Water Festival 2021, with practical training for young people on environmental conservation in the community.*

# Bangkok River Festival 2020 (The River of Culture 2020)

In cooperation with the Ministry of Culture, the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the Royal Thai Navy, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and the private sector, ThaiBev organized the Bangkok River Festival 2020, which was held for the sixth time on the theme of “Ruenerng Saeng Sin”. This year, the festival focused on a community-based tourism event, “Accessible, Safe, Contemporary, Unique”. It aimed to develop the sustainable benefits of “Bowon” in sharing knowledge and pushing the cultural values and identity of the community. It also tied in with the international contemporary art festival Bangkok Art Biennale 2020 (BAB 2020) in sharing Thainess with the world.

At the same time, ThaiBev organized the second Lamphun River Festival, which included floating krathong on the Khuang River, one of the main rivers that nourish the life and culture of Lanna people, and offering lanterns at Wat Phra That Hariphunchai. There were many other interesting activities to join at Tha Nang Gate in Lamphun.

The event areas were certified as following COVID-19 safety standards, by the Amazing Thailand Safety and Health Administration (SHA) and the Ministry of Public Health.

## Royal Tuition Scholarship Program for Thai Monks, dedicated to His Late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej on the Anniversary of his Death

The Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation and ThaiBev contributed to the Royal Tuition Scholarship Program for Thai Monks for the fourth year, to offer merit to His Late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej on the anniversary of his death on 13 October 2021. Held in the Ubosot of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, Bangkok, this donation helped to fulfill the royal wish to promote monks' studies, as well as earning royal merit in the presence of Somdej Phra Wanrat, the abbot of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara.

## Wachiraklao Thammanusorn Tripitaka Hall

The Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation and Thai Beverage Public Company Limited held the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Wachiraklao Thammanusorn Tripitaka Hall at Wat Wachiratham Sathit Worawihan, Phra Khanong District, Bangkok, on 24 January 2020. The hall was built to pay tribute and offer worship to His Majesty the King on the auspicious occasion of his coronation ceremony. Phra Phiphatranakithana, the abbot of Wat Wachiratham Sathit, presided over the clergy, while Mr. Thapana and Ms. Papatchaya Sirivadhanabhakdi were in charge of the laying of the foundation stone.

On 9 April 2021, Mr. Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi performed a ceremony to enshrine the emblem of the 2019 coronation on the Tripitaka Hall. Mr. Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi and Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi, along with their family, built the Wachiraklao Thammanusorn Tripitaka Hall as a storage place for palm-leaf scriptures and Lanna books made from khoi. A two-storey building in the Lanna style, it has an area of about 137 square meters. Completed at the end of 2020, the ground floor is concrete, while the upper floor is made of teak, decorated with real gold leaf patterns.

# Murals in the Phra Phuttha Nak Wihan, Wat Prayurawongsawas Worawihan

On the occasion of His Majesty the King’s coronation in 2019, Wat Prayurawongsawas Worawihan felt extremely joyful and thought that the Phra Phuttha Nak Wihan, an important religious building in the temple, would benefit from being painted. It was decided that this was a very auspicious opportunity to paint murals of His Majesty the King’s coronation, the royal duties of all the monarchs of the Chakri Dynasty, and the history of Wat Prayurawongsawas Worawihan, in honor of His Majesty the King.

The Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation and Thai Beverage Public Company Limited have committed to supporting the painting process, which will take 4 years (2021–2024). There are plans to transfer techniques and skills to young art students, who will come to further their studies by working with the team of Ajarn Chamnong Rattanakul, an artist with much experience and expertise in painting murals. This is a great chance to pass on the skills of Thai craftsmen to a new generation.

# The Restoration Project of the Silver Buddha Image, in the Posture of Giving Alms, Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya, Ratchaworawihan, Surat Thani Province

ThaiBev has sponsored the restoration of an antique silver Buddha image in the posture of holding an alms bowl.

# Insights

## Thanphuying Sirikitja Jensen
**Operative Arts Officer, Office of Literature and History, Fine Arts Department**

### The Charm of History
To make the new generation interested in learning history sustainably, you have to begin by adjusting your attitude, in order to attract their attention, and adjusting your communication and teaching methods. If the learning is just to take exams and measure results, it may not be sustainable learning. If the new generation does not study seriously or come into contact with reality, then history may be lost in the future. But if they have had a shared experience, they will feel that history is part of their lives, and there is a chance that history will be preserved and published.

Being a curator for the “Glass Plate Negatives: Stories that Transcend Time” exhibition has changed my point of view. The real benefit of history is felt in the present. Actually, people’s feelings have not changed, it’s just that advances in science and technology have changed the tools for recording history. If we want to know what the future will be, let’s look back at the past, through evidence recorded in various formats that change with time.

## Mr. Yuthasak Supasorn
**Governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand**

### Bangkok Art Biennale: a Blueprint for Promoting Tourism and Developing Sustainable Quality Tourism
The second Bangkok Art Biennale in 2020 presented masterpieces by internationally renowned artists. It was a gathering place for art and culture lovers from all over the world. This provides confirmation of our improved situation and Thailand’s ability and readiness to welcome tourists with safety and a smile, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand is pleased and confident that the Bangkok Art Biennale 2020 will enhance the potential of cultural tourism for both Thai and foreigners, bringing benefits in creativity, revitalizing the mind, and stimulating the tourism economy again. During the global economic recession, Thailand continues to move forward with a blueprint for promoting tourism and developing sustainable quality tourism.

## Mr. Phuthon Phumathon
**Archeology Scholar, National Science Museum**

### Museum
Museums are places where things are collected for display, interpretation, and education. To enjoy the museum, you must value, or see the values in, stories from the past. Museums must provide interdisciplinary knowledge, knowing that values in the world change all the time. As a creator of wisdom in society, you must have morals and ethics to achieve sustainable benefits. With support from the public and private sectors, there will be good opportunities to further develop museums.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

## Mr. Tul Hiranyalawan
**President of The Royal Photographic Society of Thailand (RPST)**

### Photography: an enchanting art for everyone

With today’s communication technology, you have to modify the way you present works, from gallery exhibitions to online platforms which can communicate to a large group of people quickly. This has allowed each person to try to create something new to access the audience and help them understand the purpose of the work. If something is able to communicate through the popularity of the photographic world, it will be able to coexist in this era. You have to find your own strengths to create uniqueness.

As Vice President of the Photographic Society of Thailand and a photography teacher for more than 10 years, one thing I have always sought to do is to transfer knowledge that can be used for further development. Students can apply knowledge as the basis for developing their career paths, and entrepreneurs can develop their product communication through photos. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the “Kinjai” project was organized for new entrepreneurs to take food photos. It followed a sustainable development model, creating video clips for them to learn photography by themselves.



## Mr. Asadawut Sakrik
**Secretary General of the Luang Pradit Phairoh (Sorn Silpabanleng) Foundation**

### Thai music: Who said it’s boring?

Giving Thai music a sustainable direction must start from the definition of Thai music. It’s something that has always evolved, and it can adapt to the changing era of today. Thai music can be modified in order to stay popular in a sustainable way.

The work of the Luang Pradit Phairoh (Sorn Silpabanleng) Foundation has always adapted, but still continues to disseminate knowledge of Thai music to the younger generations. The main activity that has been carried out for nearly ten years under the support of ThaiBev is the Sornthong Thai Music Competition Project for the royal trophy. This allows us to meet more than a thousand students, music teachers, and music personnel each year. At Sornthong Youth Camp, young people gain technical knowledge of Thai music. The foundation has added to the curriculum lessons about making musical instruments related to community life. The latest project, Friends of Music, is a network of music people who travel around the country to support the musical needs of schools and communities, by focusing on music events that are related to community activities.

We are proud of seeing the development of young people who are interested in Thai music. To pass on Thai music from generation to generation, I would like to give encouragement to three main groups. The first is the conservation groups, who need to use all their energy and willpower to get a wider response. The next group is the educators, including organizations, foundations, and teachers. And the last group is the creators of something new, who need encouragement to keep going. This is important because Thai music can be sustainable, if developed consistently.

### From guitar lover to world champion and business owner

Success in life comes from enthusiasm, ambition, following your dreams and doing everything you love. As a student at the College of Music, Mahidol University, I practiced diligently until I received a scholarship to travel to many world-class competitions, with support from ThaiBev. My biggest success was winning the 2014 International Classical Guitar Competition of the Guitar Foundation of America. From then on, I have been able to build a successful career, starting a business to create my own "Fonzo" guitars, with the aim of making a Thai guitar brand one of the best three in the world. I believe that life can be successful if we follow three principles: doing only what you love, what you like, and what you are passionate about, because at least then we are happy. Even though it sometimes takes a lot of patience, never stop and never think that you are not ready. If one day I had thought that I was not ready to continue practicing, I would never have received funding from ThaiBev and I would not have been able to achieve my dreams.

As the organizer of an international contemporary art festival, in addition to educating young people about contemporary art and helping promote the Thai art industry around the world, Bangkok Art Biennale aims to strengthen the economy of Bangkok. In the area of tourism, an important responsibility is to take care of the world in a sustainable way. We believe that art not only creates beauty, but also leads to awareness, more or less. Art can play a role in life in all its dimensions. BAB has therefore got involved in a project that sharpens its environmental focus, especially in creating basic awareness among young people, by working with Thailand Sustainability Expo. BAB 2018 artists Komkrit Tepthian and Kriit Ngamsom brought together other artists with the ability to create artwork from waste. Pattida Prasarnthong (Kru Pang) and Ajarn Aoi joined the "Trash to Treasure" activity.

Knowledge allied with creativity led to the development of inventions from waste materials, which in turn were developed into works of art, so creating an impression and raising awareness of the environment. The policy of the Bangkok Art Biennale (BAB) is to promote compliance with the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals and create a path to happiness through art activities, in collaboration with Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd., food supplement company Feed Addition Co., Ltd., and Prof. Thavorn Ko-udomvit.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Sustainability Report 2021

The activities were carried out by visiting the area to organize workshop activities for artists. They learned how to use waste materials from production processes to create valuable artworks with their own skills. The value of this kind of project lies in raising awareness of all the waste problems that the world is facing.

The artists participating in the workshop, including BAB 2018 artists, were:

- Ms. Dao Wasiksiri
- Mr. Jitsing Somboon
- Asst. Prof. Wuttikorn Gangan
- Assoc. Prof. Kamol Phasowas
- Ajan Songwit Pimprakan
- Mr. Krit Ngamsom
- Mr. Konkrit Thepthian
- Ms. Saneethat Praditthatsanee
- Mr. Tawatchai Phansuwan
- Mr. Panphan Yodmanee

## Towards 2025 and Beyond

ThaiBev continues to promote arts, culture, and the "Pride of Thainess", according to its aspirations for stable and sustainable social development activities. Because the arts and culture are universal and interconnected, it's possible to build cooperation among all sectors of society, to achieve the effective implementation of ThaiBev’s socially responsible activities.

The strategy is grounded in 4 principles: stable growth, sustainability, creating value, collaboration, and partnership. These principles are followed by the working groups in 4 fields: Visual Arts, Music and Literary Arts, Culture and Traditions, and Buddhism.

Such is our commitment to artistic and cultural promotion. The goal is to create jobs that help to develop diverse communities, each with a unique identity in terms of land type, occupations, and economy. Cultural development activities bring about an openness that helps us to join together and understand each other. The private sector is ready to jointly support community development so that social and economic structures become strong, self-sufficient, and happy, and communities are ready to create value and share with society at large. When a strong society grows steadily, we are ready to create values and contribute to the development of the nation through sustainable progress.

# Community and Social Development

Over the past 16 years, ThaiBev has placed great emphasis on building relationships with communities. The company remains committed to the sustainable development of communities by focusing on collaborative thinking and collaborative projects, with the aim of creating sustainable and self-reliant local economies. This kind of relationship-building in projects such as “ThaiBev Creates a Good Community with Smiles” also enhances the organization’s image. All around the world, societies are battling COVID-19. ThaiBev continues working to help communities and society so that all sectors can get through the crisis together.

# 2021 Highlight

## The Chumchondee Meerojirim Project for a New Generation

The project started in 2018 with the aim of harnessing the power of young people who return to their hometown. It operates in the form of a social enterprise to drive the local economy in accordance with the sufficiency economy philosophy, and to expand the goal to include sustainable development by focusing on collaboration at the local level. Cooperation in social, economic, and environmental development is encouraged, based on the needs and potential of each community. Through collaborative thinking and development, we can carry out concrete projects, which will lead to self-management in the future. ThaiBev is currently running the project in 15 districts in 14 provinces.

# Community 1: Chumchondee Meeroijim Prachinburi (Social Business groups), Prachinburi Province

## Development of a Community Learning Center about Sustainable Economics

This project is based around the Organic Agriculture Community Enterprise Group, Lat Takhian Sub-district, Kabinburi District, Prachinburi Province. There are 40 members in the group, with the aim of developing the community as a source of safe food production, and of expanding into organic farming on a 15-rai organic vegetable farm. It is beneficial to the public and adheres to the principle of an honest livelihood, which means not oppressing others and not being oppressed oneself. The project was upgraded as a learning center and a model of organic agriculture for the community.

## Activities and Results

- The area has been developed through volunteer activities with Thai Beverage Logistics Company Limited, such as repairing chicken houses and organic fertilizer production houses, and installing water systems in vegetable plots and perennial plots for mango and jackfruit trees.
- Two types of agricultural technology are supported: a water pump and a solar incubator from the Prachinburi Provincial Energy Office, respectively to solve the problem of water shortage and to preserve herbs.
- Membership has grown from 29 to 40, expanding the agricultural area covered by 12 rai. There are also plans to expand into a network of organic farming of 100 households at the sub-district level.

## Personnel Development

- In order to upgrade the quality of their agricultural products, six members of the group have applied for Organic Thailand certification, and there are plans to expand this by two members each year. Three members per year are being encouraged to develop their potential in the Young Smart Farmer project.

## Marketing

- Developing distribution channels for organic vegetables in the form of direct and pre-order sales to the following markets: Lemon Farm Shop, Chaopraya Abhaiphubejhr Hospital, NP FOOD Company Limited, Kabinburi Hospital, and Fuengfuannat Company Limited (affiliated company). Opening pre-order sales of safe vegetable products through the community FB pages and the community enterprise FB page.
- Collaborating with the Social Activities Department of Jinlong Construction (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (VP House) to open a community shop in front of the learning center.

## Insights

**Mrs. Dara Khemkham**  
Chairman of the Organic Agriculture Community Enterprise Group, Lat Takhian Sub-district, Prachinburi Province

Since the ThaiBev volunteers came to help develop our area, the members have been very motivated to get together again. There are also staff from ThaiBev to consult with about establishing and managing membership groups, marketing, and planting planning. Using the concept of market-led production, we will produce products according to market demand, so that every member can earn income. Now we have encouragement and can smile happily again.

# Community 2: Chumchondee Meeroijim Phatthalung (Social Business groups), Phatthalung Province

## Krajood Product Development

Based in Khuan Khanun District, Phatthalung Province, this project is an extension of the traditional industry of weaving krajood (saltmarsh bulrush) in the area. The main occupations there are fishing, weaving, embroidery, and basketry. After analyzing the problems, it was found that products needed to be updated, and that new marketing channels should be sought.

### Activities and Results

- In 2021, a group of 105 members was registered as a community enterprise at Ban Hua Pa Khiao Arts and Crafts Center, Phatthalung Province. A business plan was made to organize the group and build up the krajood network in the area. Ban Khok Mao Krajood Community Enterprise Group has become a mentor for the group and is a joint member of the group’s effort to develop krajood products.

- Developing and passing on knowledge of the krajood handicraft production process of weaving, forming, sewing and assembling krajood bags. Upgrading the enterprise to be a comprehensive learning center for krajood.

- Setting up a demonstration plot of krajood planting in a 10-rai area to serve as a learning center for the community.

- Developing a brand of premium krajood bags, "JOODDY".

- Expanding marketing channels for the group by collaborating with Pracharath Rak Samakkee (Thailand) Social Enterprise Co., Ltd. to find markets for krajood products, generating income for the community of over 1.6 million THB, with 250 household beneficiaries.

## Insights

**Mrs. Arun Ma-iad,**  
Chairman of the Krajood Community Enterprise Group, Ban Khok Mao District, Phatthalung Province

I would like to say thanks to Community Development Projects at ThaiBev, Chumchondee Meeroijim Phatthalung (Social Business groups), and Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd., for not abandoning the community and helping find orders for krajood bags. This has helped my group members to have work and earn money in the COVID-19 situation. This also helped the other four or five villages who shared the work with us. There is money for children to go to school, and to buy food to eat. Thank you very much. The community will definitely not forget the kindness that has been shown to us at this time. Thank you.

# Community 3: Chumchondee Meeroojim Krabi (Social Business groups), Krabi Province

## Sea Cucumber Project, Koh Pu Island Community

This project operates in the island community of Ban Koh Pu, Koh Sriboya Sub-district, Nuea Khlong District in Krabi Province. Most villagers are engaged in fishing, with sea cucumbers being their most important catch. Live and processed sea cucumbers are traded, generating income for the community for many years. The Sea Cucumber Project aims to increase income by expanding sea cucumber cultivation and processing, creating work and income, and serving as a pilot for community economic development using the Andaman Sea's resources.

Chumchondee Meeroojim Krabi (Social Business groups) has organized a group to establish the Sea Cucumber Community Enterprise on Koh Pu. With over 50 members, they have expanded the sea cucumber cultivation area. By issuing shares for the expansion of breeding pens over 1 rai, more than 3,000 sea cucumbers have been raised. Andaman Pracharath is driving the development of the whole project, aiming to make the area a center for sea cucumber cultivation and processing in Thailand's Andaman Sea provinces. The community is encouraged to develop further products and connect to markets for fresh, dried, and ready-to-cook sea cucumber meat in the southern region.

## Ban Koh Pu Island Community Tourism

Tourism in Ban Koh Pu community has been developing since 2013. The main goal is for people to benefit from the area's resources, considering culture, conservation, and preserving existing resources.

Chumchondee Meeroojim Krabi (Social Business groups) sees potential in the community and resource availability. The project has played a part in developing, promoting, and integrating a community tourism enterprise. In Ban Koh Pu, 50 members have formulated a plan for tourism development, creating tourism routes and activities: tourism by sea, tourism on land, and CSR activity packages.

The group has also developed marketing and public relations capabilities, collaborating with public and private sectors to create income for the community.

## Seafood and Seafood Processing Project for Ban Koh Pu Community, Women’s Group

Ban Koh Pu community is a key seafood source for Krabi Province, rich in marine resources. Seafood is generally sold to local craftsmen, but the selling price is low. Chumchondee Meeroojim Krabi (Social Business groups) plans to develop marketing channels for Ban Koh Pu fishermen to sell seafood directly to consumers. Seafood can be processed into ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat products as alternatives for customers. The goal is to deliver fresh, good-quality, safe products to consumers nationwide, generating work and income for the community.

Chumchondee Meeroojim Krabi (Social Business groups) has driven forward the group’s work by organizing meetings to develop a women’s group to process seafood. There are 32 members planning to develop processed seafood such as sun-dried fish, blue crab chili pastes, grilled fish chili paste, and ready-to-cook sea cucumbers. The women’s group will work with the sea cucumber group to set up a processed sea cucumber production base and develop product marketing to increase income.

**Mr. Thanayot Lanlongsa**  
Chairman of the Sea Cucumber Community Enterprise, Koh Pu, Krabi Province

Thank you very much to ThaiBev for sending staff to set up a community development project in the area. They are very determined to work, learn things with the community, and train the community to run the business based on the capital we have. In addition, they join in monitoring and evaluating the results of our work, and get together groups of villagers to drive the sea cucumber project forward. This is a development channel that can truly create work and income for the community.



**Mr. Samart Kembase**  
Chairman of Ban Koh Pu Community Tourism Group, Krabi Province

Thank you ThaiBev for joining the community development project in the area, and for being the driving force for community-based tourism here as well. This has made people interested in joining the tourism development group, in order to drive community tourism forward again.

# Key Projects

## “ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold”

The “ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold” project has been underway for over 22 years. ThaiBev is determined to continue sharing the warmth by giving “Green Blankets” to people in the northern and northeastern regions, with collaboration from the Ministry of Interior, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, and other allies in the public and private sectors. Up to now, 4,400,000 blankets have been given out in total. In addition, ThaiBev attaches great importance to environmental issues. This is the second year of production of eco-friendly blankets, which are recycled fleece blankets made from used plastic bottles. The 200,000 blankets distributed each year reduce the waste of 7.6 million water bottles (one blanket is made of 38 bottles).

In addition to delivering blankets, the project also provides opportunities in education, by granting scholarships and teaching equipment to many schools, and provides assistance in the field of public health. Coordinating with local hospitals, ThaiBev arranges for mobile medical teams to provide check-ups to the people who come to receive blankets.

ThaiBev has also encouraged its employees to be part of sharing the warmth, by launching the campaign “1 Share, 1 Warmth.” This aims to provide donated blankets to children and young people in areas other than the 15 provinces selected for the “ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold” project. The objective is to encourage the power of collaboration among all sectors in building a sustainable, giving society.

### Community Assistance Project during the COVID-19 Situation: Online Marketing to Sell Community Products

Many communities in Thailand have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as they cannot sell or export their agricultural products. The problem of oversupply results from middlemen being unable to purchase products from farming communities, and processed goods are also affected by the disruption to tourism.

Chumchondee Meerouijm project, however, has turned crisis into opportunity, by educating farming communities about the new era of marketing. Given knowledge of product development, public relations through online media, and delivery management systems, these communities can generate income once again. This has encouraged and built confidence in the communities, who are now ready to face whatever the future may bring. With the collaboration of community business development officers in each province and central company employees, a survey has been carried out to collect product information from communities that have suffered, so that they can develop online marketing channels on the LINE platform. 

So far, the project has generated income for the communities of 2,020,950 THB. There are 24 communities participating and 1,216 members receiving the benefits.

Pak Phanang District, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province

This year, our pomelo trees have yielded a lot. But we are still stuck for transportation and distribution due to the COVID situation. Fortunately, Chumchondee Meeroijim project has helped out. If the project had not helped, we wouldn’t have been able to move our produce. I have to thank Chumchondee Meeroijim project for really coming to the aid of farmers.



**Mr. Montree Siriwut**  
A farmer and owner of the rambutan orchard at Rongrien Rambutan Farmer Group, Muangtod School,  
Ban Na San District, Surat Thani Province

I am glad that ThaiBev and Chumchondee Meeroijim project have come to help agriculture. Our products have become known among many local people who previously hadn’t heard of them. The growers are very pleased with the many things that ThaiBev has done to help.

# Ban Huai Bong Mountain Water Supply Project, Mae Chaem District, Chiang Mai Province

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people in Thailand lost their jobs and had to return to their hometowns, including the mahouts of Ban Huai Bong, Mae Chaem District, Chiang Mai Province, who were working in the city. When the crisis hit, their elephant camps closed. The mahouts and their elephants had no income, so decided to return to their home village without preparation. Consequently, there is a severe shortage of food for the elephants. ThaiBev, Chumchondee Meeroijim Mae Chaem (Social Business groups) project, Mae Chaem District and the community have come together to plan to build food sustainability for the elephants, along with other development plans such as community-based tourism (Elephant Village) in the future. ThaiBev has established a water supply system, bringing the water over a distance of 2 km so that the elephants and mahouts have sufficient water to supply an area of 21 rai. The community can also use it for agricultural benefits. A group of mahouts has formed an enterprise called "Elephant Returning Home Community Enterprise at Ban Huai Bong," to improve the native rice farming of the hill tribes by making a rice mill, in order to develop a brand of mountain rice known as "Mu Ke Po".

The results of this project benefit 60 households in Ban Huai Bong, 20 mahouts, over 20 elephants, and the mountain water supply system can store 4,500 liters of water per day.

## Insights

Because of the COVID-19 situation, me and the other mahouts decided to come back to our home village. Because the elephant camps had no tourists and no income, we felt downhearted and wanted to start over again at home. The mahouts got together to talk about how we could make a new start and decided to form a community enterprise group. We met with the Chumchondee Meeroijim Mae Chaem (Social Business groups) when ThaiBev came to help with the mountain water supply, providing elephants with clean drinking water. Previously, the drinking water sources had been contaminated with chemicals from monoculture farming, which is dangerous for elephants. In addition, the community uses it for farming, growing vegetables and grass for the elephants. I am very glad that Chumchondee Meeroijim Mae Chaem (Social Business groups) and ThaiBev have reached out to help. All our members are delighted, at a time when there is no agency work available to help them. ThaiBev has given us a lot of encouragement and a desire to develop ourselves. We would like to continue to develop the group, and in the future will develop homestay tourism. For now there is a rice mill, which ThaiBev has continued to support by developing the community rice brand and finding marketing channels. Thank you, ThaiBev, very much.

# Local Pakaoma Handicraft Project

The culture of weaving Pakaoma is found in every province of the country. If a simple Pakaoma can be developed to create other items of good quality, it will create employment opportunities and sustainable income for the community. This idea is the starting point of a project, in collaboration with Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and the Department of Community Development in the Ministry of Interior, which has been running since 2016.

The main goal is to change consumers' perception towards Pakaoma. This will lead to the development of high-quality products that will meet market demand and generate sustainable income for the community.

Since the end of 2020, despite the COVID-19 situation, the local Pakaoma handicraft project has continued to focus on working closely with Pakaoma manufacturers, but now under intensive disease surveillance and prevention measures. In collaboration with the eisa (Education Institute Support Activity) team, this project has brought together a new generation to develop the identity of hand-woven Pakaoma, through the "Creative Young Designers" initiative.

# Providing Booth Areas to Showcase and Sell Community Products

To keep the situation of COVID-19 under control, the Thai government has kept the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situations since 26 March 2020. This directly affects the groups and communities in the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network at the provincial level, where the majority of revenue comes from the sale of goods and services. In the past, Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. collaborated with government agencies, the private sector, and network partners to create spaces where communities can display and sell products.

However, since 2020 most exhibition and retail spaces have been subjected to restrictions, and many activities have been canceled indefinitely. Nevertheless, some have been able to operate, as long as they implement measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and this has generated income for thirteen groups and communities totaling over 4.98 million THB.

# Operating Results

- Providing booth areas to showcase and sell community products, totaling 99 events, involving 400 communities.
- Generating income for the community totaling more than 48 million THB.
- Organizing 13 events during the COVID-19 epidemic (2020 to the present), generating income for the community totaling more than 4.98 million THB.

# Insights

## Executives and Project Supporters Share Their Values

### Ms. Tiwaporn Srivorakul
Managing Director, Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Kanchanaburi) Co., Ltd.

The Food Safety in Hospital Project believes that all patients should be able to eat clean food, to reduce the risk of illness. Farmers who grow organic vegetables can produce safe food for hospitals. I believe that our success in Kanchanaburi is partly due to the fact that I am the chairman of an organic agriculture network in Kanchanaburi Province, which makes it easy for us to provide safe food. We have received great support from the governor, who has cooperated with us in procuring refrigerated trucks for transporting vegetables, as well as finding a large cold storage for storing them. The central Pracharath Rak Samakkee Thailand organization has taken care of various problems. The Department of Community Development has been very cooperative, as well as supportive in granting capital from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives to move our produce. I have to thank Chumchondee Meeroijim project for really coming to the aid of farmers.

### Suchin Phowichit
Chairman of the Weaving and Sewing Group at Baan Hat Siew, Sukhothai Province

In the past, our group has woven simple Pakaoma, most of which were sold to people within the community. But after joining the local Pakaoma handicraft project in 2017 and winning the first prize for processed Pakaoma, we are starting to be well known. With the support of Pracharath Thailand, who helped us expand our distribution channels by providing booth sale areas and selling our products at the Pracharath Rak Samakkee shop, we have attracted more attention and market demand. Last year, students from Dhurakij Pundit University came to give their advice and make our products even more valuable. We are glad that young people see the value of Thai Pakaoma. We are so grateful that the project has enabled people in our community to be happy and live better lives.

### Ms. Meena Sisa-ard
Colorful Tie Dye Fashion Community Enterprise, Samut Prakan Province

I am very happy and thankful to Pracharath Rak Samakkee Thailand for providing booths to sell our products. With some trade fairs, if you contact them yourself, the cost of space rental is quite high. Sales are sometimes up and down, but that's normal in this trade and in the current economic crisis, it is better than not having a chance to sell at all. I really have to say thank you.

# Trash to Treasure Contest 2021

The Trash to Treasure Contest was held for the second time in 2021 to promote young talent, with 150,000 THB in total prize money and certificates for winners. The young people who took part in the project were required to create 2D and 3D artworks out of trash such as plastic bottles and plastic bags in order to show that trash can be valuable, with the goal of raising awareness of environmental issues and encouraging trash reuse. A panel of experts, including nationally recognized art experts, judged the competition. The Trash to Treasure Contest 2021 managed to draw 268 students from 14 educational institutions, with 126 competing in the 2D contest and 142 competing in the 3D contest.

# TSX Sustainable Innovation Competition and Hackathon 2021

The TSX Sustainable Innovation Competition & Hackathon 2021, held for the first time in 2021 in collaboration with CU Innovation Hub to promote young talent, aimed to find the best innovators on the theme of "Disrupting Health & Wellness Experience in COVID-19."

The winners received a total of 80,000 THB in prize money as well as certificates. Only 15 teams were chosen for the Case competition round out of a total of 78 candidate teams; seven teams were chosen for the 48-hour Incubation and Virtual Hackathon final round.

The ATTRA team won first place for developing PULSED UVC, a high-performance sterilizer (at a current of 240 amps and energy of 240-360 mJ/cm). The energy is used to light a bulb, which emits UVC rays similar to a camera flash. At the level of microorganisms, viruses, and fungal spores, the flash of light destroys the DNA structure. According to destructive efficiency tests, this machine can kill 99.99 percent of germs in 30-60 seconds and costs only 4 THB per hour. It is suitable for large corporations such as department stores and general real estate operators. The team estimated that they could sell the machines to around a thousand house units in the real estate industry, generating enough revenue to cover the investment.

Share Care won second place with their concept of Paradise Pocket Space, which will allow city dwellers to access privately owned green spaces and redesign them to better meet people's needs. The project aims to increase the number of green spaces by emphasizing participation, with the public able to join the scheme on an ownership basis. More people will be able to relax and find inspiration outside of the typical working environment, as well as meet others who share similar ideas and lifestyles. According to research, mental health problems are on the rise as a result of economic stress and a lack of social activities to participate in, but they can be alleviated by access to green spaces.

People will have to pay an entrance fee to enter the parks, but everyone is considered an "owner" in a managing partnership on the app, which displays information such as Home, Membership, Park browsing, Density checking, and so on. It is hoped that Paradise Pocket Space will help solve the problem of Bangkok's numerous unused empty spaces by demonstrating that, when costs and benefits are considered, the scheme provides more value than renting them.

# C asean Consonant: ASEAN Traditional Music Challenge

With the aim to create a knowledge tank of ASEAN traditional music presenting heritages of ASEAN arts and culture on online media, C asean Consonant musicians with their families and friends represented the beauty of ASEAN Traditional Music through video clips of musical performances, with demonstrations of 31 national instruments by 35 musicians from 10 countries, performing 19 songs in 8 ASEAN dialects with English subtitles. It is not only an educational medium for all genders and ages, but these works of art also help foster friendship and understanding, and narrow the gaps between races and genders through culture and music. In spite of different identities, they represent the beauty that coexists peacefully. This is the foundation for reducing inequalities and creating quality education of ASEAN arts & culture which created partnership for sustainable collaboration.

## Sustainability Action Hero Talks

![Sustainability Action Hero Talks](image2.jpg)

A concurrent activity of Sustainability Action Hero Photo Contest, "Sustainability Action Hero Talks" is a series of discussions and exchanges of knowledge, experiences, ideas, and perspectives on 17 topics of sustainable development. The speakers consisted of those who have successfully applied sustainable development in their lives, making noteworthy contributions by creating businesses and developing societies. The talks were conceived as a platform to encourage people who still need more experiences, ideas, and networks in putting ideas of sustainable development into practice.

# COVID-19 Response

Organize the discussion in a hybrid media format strictly in accordance with the Ministry of Public Health’s requirements to prevent the spread of the epidemic. The data is stored in electronic media to serve as a knowledge base for interested people to study further during the period. There is a social distance requirement.

# LR Independent Assurance Statement

**Relating to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for the fiscal year 2021 (1st October 2020 – 30th September 2021)**

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.

## Terms of Engagement

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (LR) was commissioned by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev), to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report (“the report”) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LR’s verification procedure. LR’s verification procedure is based on current best practice, is in accordance with SAE 3000 and uses the following principles of - inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and reliability of performance data.

Our assurance engagement covered ThaiBev’s operations and activities in Thailand, Myanmar, and United Kingdom specifically the following requirements:

- Confirming that the report is in accordance with GRI Standards (2016) and core option
- Evaluating the reliability of data and information for only the selected environmental and social indicators listed below:
  - **Economic:** GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed (community investment)
  - **Environmental:** GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization, GRI 302-3 Energy intensity, GRI 303-3 (2018 edition) Water withdrawal, GRI 303-4 (2018 edition) Water discharge, GRI 303-5 (2018 edition) Water consumption, GRI 305-1 Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, GRI 305-5 Other indirect GHG emissions (Selected Scope 3), GRI 305-4 GHG emissions intensity, GRI 306-3 (2020 edition) Waste generated, GRI 306-4 (2020 edition) Waste diverted from disposal and GRI 306-5 (2020 edition) Waste directed to disposal Induced food loss and food waste.
  - **Social:** GRI 403-3 (2018 edition) Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system, GRI 403-9 (2018 edition) Work-related injuries, GRI 403-10 (2018 edition) Work-related ill health, GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee, GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews, GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs and non-GRI Vulnerability Assessment for IT security.

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the report.

LR’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LR disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analyzing and presenting all the data and information within the report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived. Ultimately, the report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

## LR’s Opinion

Based on LR’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not, in all material respects:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier.

**Note:** The extent of evidence gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

## LR’s Approach

LR’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Assessing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement to confirm that issues raised by stakeholders were captured correctly. We did this by interviewing ThaiBev’s Management who engage directly with stakeholder groups as well as reviewing documents and associated records.

*GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty.*

# Lloyd's Register

- Auditing ThaiBev's data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or mis-statements in the data. This was done by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal verification. Discussions were held with key personnel responsible for compiling the data and drafting the report.
- Collaboration of the third-party report for ThaiBev's IT security Vulnerability Assessment in February 2021.
- Confirming the reliability of the selected specific standards' data by sampling evidence at:

  **Spirit & Beer Group:**
  - Fuengfuanant Company Limited, Prachinburi Province, Thailand

  **Non Alcoholic Beverage Group:**
  - Sermsuk Public Company Limited, Nakorn Pathom and Nakorn Ratchasima, Thailand
  - Oishi Trading Company Limited, Saraburi Province, Thailand

  **Supply Chain Management Operations:**
  - Thai Beverage Energy Company Limited, Prachinburi Province, Thailand
  - Thai Beverage Recycle Company Limited, Nakorn Ratchasima Province, Thailand
  - Thai Beverage Logistics Company Limited, Chonburi Province, Thailand

**Note:**
1. LR did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations.
2. Data for United Kingdom and Myanmar were reviewed remotely.

## Observations

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:

- **Inclusivity:**
  - We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from ThaiBev's engagement process.

- **Materiality:**
  - ThaiBev has processes for revalidate material issues; the process considers factors such as stakeholder concerns, business risks and legal compliance and we are not aware of any major material issue having been excluded.

- **Responsiveness:**
  - ThaiBev and its subsidiaries have processes for responding to various stakeholder groups. We believe that ThaiBev should address further on food waste management through its stakeholder groups, typically with supply chains and operations.

- **Reliability:**
  - Data management systems are established and centralized for the data and information collection and calculation associated with the selected GRI indicators.

## LR’s Standards, Competence and Independence

LR ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.

This verification is the only work undertaken by LR for ThaiBev and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.

| Water Demand | Demands for water consumption. |   |
| Water Sustainability Assessments (WSA) | A detailed assessment performed at sites to study the interaction of stakeholders in the region with local water sources. The assessment studies on-site practices and their impacts on the water body and other stakeholders, as well as the practice of other stakeholders. Environmental data such as meteorology, terrain, and aquifers are also studied to predict the sustainability of water supply in the region at the current time and in the future. |   |
| Watershed | The area that is surrounded by water boundary and collects water from many rivers in that basin. When it rains the water will flow from the watershed to different levels of water body, from sub-order, order to mainstream, and finally to the outlet level where water releases to the estuary. |   |
| Water supply | The ability to provide water. |   |
| Watt | Power measuring unit indicating the energy consumption rate of any particular equipment or appliance. |   |
| Wetland | Wetland is a natural wastewater treatment system.
