# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited Progress Report

I am excited to report that Thai Beverage Public Company Limited ("**ThaiBev**") has made substantial progress towards fulfilling our goal of becoming the stable and sustainable total beverage leader in the ASEAN market by 2020. We are now a member of both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ("**DJSI**") for World and the DJSI for Emerging Markets. Significantly, we attained perfect scores in almost twice as many of the assessment areas compared to last year. Our remarkable inclusion in the component of the DJSI World Index after only one year from our inclusion as a member of the DJSI for Emerging Markets is the result of our complete commitment to achieving our "Vision 2020" objectives, which have been clearly laid out under five imperatives – growth, diversity, brands, reach, and professionalism. With this ranking upgrade, ThaiBev has achieved a higher standing in the international arena as an organization that delivers growth in a sustainable manner to maximize long-term benefits for stakeholders. This accomplishment is not only encouraging; it also spurs us to enhance our commitment to sustainable development and policies.

We continue to focus on "Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth" among all stakeholders, including those within our company, in the communities where we operate and other areas across Thailand. This is being achieved through our corporate social responsibility initiatives and our support of the Thai government’s Pracharath program.

ThaiBev’s journey towards greater sustainability is guided by the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy ("**SEP**") of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanathbophit and inspired by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals ("**SDGs**"), which can be viewed from three perspectives. From an economic perspective, we believe in long-term business commitments with a clear framework for financial discipline. From an environmental perspective, we look to implement green policies along our entire value chain. From a social perspective, we focus on working with communities to help create value and drive growth. The SEP principle is the cornerstone of our support of SDGs.

One of the major commitments undertaken by ThaiBev in 2017 revolves around participating and supporting the Pracharath program, a government initiative for the public sector, private sector, academic circle, civil sector and the community to work together, in order to drive the country’s economic development, especially in rural areas.

ThaiBev has helped to form a nation-wide network of area-based social enterprises, including Pracharath Rak Samakkee (Social Enterprise) (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and 76 other social enterprises. These 77 social enterprises provide business guidance to communities in three income-generating areas – agriculture, value-added products and community-based tourism. We assist them in facilitating improvements in five areas – access to factors of production, creating know-how, marketing, communication and creating awareness of sustainability and management.

Inclusive growth is the heart of sustainability. In 2017, government efforts have helped generate local economic growth, as evident from the over 23% increase in community product sales (OTOP). This enables local communities to improve their quality of life and leads towards the achievement of the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development goals.

We have also continued to embrace the Global Reporting Initiative ("**GRI**") and focus on economic, environmental, social, as well as the arts and cultural areas in this respect. ThaiBev also supports a range of projects that directly address issues such as climate change, community well-being, sports, public health and education, as well as arts and culture.

Great opportunities lie ahead for ThaiBev. We are encouraged by what we have achieved and motivated to further our sustainable business practices. We are firmly committed in our drive for corporate excellence in order to become the leading stable and sustainable total beverage company in the ASEAN market by 2020.

President and CEO

# Inspiration: The ThaiBev Sustainability Approach

# Board Statement

The ThaiBev Board (the "Board") is committed to improving the sustainability of the ThaiBev Group (the "Group"). Sustainability considerations, including environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues, are integral and essential matters which we take into account in our formulation of the overall strategy for the Group. We are fully supportive of all efforts by ThaiBev’s management team to make improvements in this area.

Furthermore, as the Group’s long-term sustainability is a key priority for the Board and as efforts in this respect depend on the management team’s implementation and operational abilities, the Board has made it clear that our evaluation of their performance takes their effectiveness in delivering on the commitments made to sustainability initiatives and targets in this report into account.

The Board is committed to being transparent, clear and open about the ThaiBev’s businesses to its shareholders and other stakeholders. The disclosures made in this report and in the Group’s annual report are in line with this commitment. In this report, we have discussed ThaiBev’s efforts to continue building on and strengthening the Group’s collaboration with business partners to drive positive economic, environmental, and social impact throughout its value chain with good governance.

The Board has assigned responsibility for overseeing ThaiBev’s sustainability initiatives and the preparation of this sustainability report to the Group’s corporate sustainability development committee and working team. The Board receives regular reports and presentations from the committee and the ThaiBev management team on their sustainability objectives, targets, initiatives, challenges, progress and achievements, as well as the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors of relevance to the Group. We will continue our efforts on this front so as to further enhance ThaiBev’s sustainability.





## Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth

As the region’s leading beverage company, ThaiBev’s dimension of ‘growth’ covers growth in both sales revenue and brand diversification in order to further accommodate our partners and consumers.

This means that we must take into account another dimension in which our partners and co-workers perform better and with more efficiency to simultaneously benefit from creativity and good intentions.

Furthermore, we take into our consideration the value everybody receives through our products and our multi-dimensional contributions to society from the environment, education, sports, and culture. With this, ThaiBev hopes to create a ripple of endless happiness that can be shared by all.

# ThaiBev Value Chain

## 1. Sourcing

To drive sustainable sourcing in an efficient manner and to develop partnership standards for sustainable growth, ThaiBev has put in place mechanisms for risk management in goods and services, in tandem with risk management for trade partners who take part in the sourcing of raw materials. ThaiBev screens partners to ensure that their work meets both environmental and social standards. All this ensures that products that enter consumers’ hands are safe and of high quality.

## 2. Production

In every stage of the manufacturing process, ThaiBev cares about safety and is conscientious about the use of various resources like water and energy, ensuring that it provides good value and maximum benefit without polluting the environment and surrounding communities. ThaiBev follows legal standards and international standards, including ISO 9000, GMP, HACCP, and ISO 14000, and has received the NSF drinking water quality certification from the National Sanitation Foundation in the United States. In addition, ThaiBev continually develops innovations and technology to ensure that its products achieve the highest quality and adhere to the highest standards, all without negatively affecting the environment and the organization’s stakeholders.

## Visual Overview

- **1. Sourcing**: Illustrated with elements like farms and factories.
- **2. Production**: Depicted with factories and headquarters.
- **5. Post-Consumption Packaging Management**: Shown with distribution centers and recycling facilities.

# Distribution

ThaiBev prioritizes good planning and strong, comprehensive distribution channels, ensuring that merchandise reaches its destination on time and in high quality. ThaiBev remains cognizant of accidents that might happen during transportation, and consequently, it has put modern technology to use in management, for example, to monitor the driving discipline of delivery drivers, and to efficiently manage fuel. As a result, the Company can control and manage the impact on different aspects of the business for stakeholders effectively.

# Marketing and Sales

ThaiBev delivers products for the consumer through efficient distribution channels by building strong networks and focusing on building good relationships with business partners through a variety of projects, such as "The Agent 'Next Gen'", which is part of the strategies of our Vision 2020. In addition, ThaiBev demonstrates its responsibility to the consumer and society through public relations, whether by using product labels which identify all nutritional details, or by organizing "Serve Responsibly" workshops or organizing sales promotions to build relationships with the consumer. At the same time, the Company remains open to consumer feedback through various channels, so as to guide product development that fully responds to the demands of the consumer.

# Post-consumption Packaging Management

With the belief that good packaging should not only protect the product and make it look pleasing, but also be reusable in the manufacturing process (using materials and packages such as paper boxes, cushioning, glass bottles, and plastic), ThaiBev designs packaging made of reusable materials, to reduce waste arising from consumption, since "single-use" disposability makes too much trash and wastes natural resources in the manufacturing of these materials.

# The ThaiBev Sustainability Approach

## Sustainable Development Strategy

ThaiBev embraces King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), in tandem with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. The Company incorporates them into its corporate guidelines to push forward its business operations in a responsible manner for society and all stakeholders.

The Sustainability Economy Philosophy framework, when put to use in business planning and operations, consists of the following 3 principles: Moderation, Reasonableness, and Prudence. If the Company abides by these 3 principles with knowledge and virtue, it will be able to remain stable and sustainable through the currents of globalization and change.

## Business Operations Foundation

Business operations should be founded on the basis of the middle path as exemplified in the three major parts of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, which are:

### Moderation
- Work following one's abilities and potential
- Avoid extremes
- Exercise financial discipline

### Reasonableness
- Assess the reasons for every action affecting stakeholders
- Create real, authentic value

### Prudence
- Manage risk
- Prepare for future impacts or changes

## Additional Conditions

Aside from these three principles, ThaiBev adheres to two conditions governing the principles, completing the diagram of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. The conditions are the use of knowledge and virtues for business planning, decision making, and various operations activities.

### Knowledge
- In-depth information
- Correct understanding
- The linking together of knowledge and experience

### Virtues
- Integrity
- Sincerity
- Diligence
- Self-awareness
- Humility

## Key Concepts

The adoption of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as a business strategy will lead to balanced progress in four dimensions: economy, society, environment, and culture. ThaiBev is confident that this approach will enable self-sustaining growth and limitless opportunities for both business and society.

### Dimensions of SEP

- **Economy**: Creating business value.
- **Environment**: Managing the impacts from business.
- **Society**: Caring and sharing.
- **Culture**: Promoting artistic and cultural conservation.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

ThaiBev aims to align with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This alignment enhances efficiency and promotes sustainable development at both domestic and international levels. Key focuses include:

- Usage of knowledge, experience, and thinking to achieve steady growth.
- Reduction of environmental impact.
- Development of human resources.

## Strategic Alignment

SEP and SDGs align with ThaiBev's Vision 2020, aiming to become a stable and sustainable leader in the ASEAN beverage industry. This involves building stronger relationships with stakeholders sustainably, in tandem with organizational growth.

## Conclusion

ThaiBev's sustainable development strategies, based on SEP and the UN's SDGs, aim for balanced progress across the value chain, maximizing benefits for society, the environment, and key stakeholders.

## The Process for Assessing Key Sustainability Issues

1. **Identification of Issues**
   - The Company selects sustainability issues that align with business operations. This is based on information from executives, experts from business units, and external experts on sustainability in the food and beverage industry. It involves understanding global trends, industry issues, and stakeholder surveys on corporate sustainability.

2. **Issue Prioritization**
   - The Company ranks identified issues by priority, considering their impact on business operations and stakeholder opinions. The result is a prioritized list of significant corporate sustainability issues.

3. **Validation**
   - The Corporate Sustainability Development Working Team verifies the comprehensiveness of key issues. The list is reviewed by the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee and then presented to the Board of Directors for approval and implementation.

4. **Establishment of Reporting Boundary**
   - The Company defines the scope of reporting for all 20 key issues, using information from various agencies and stakeholder groups.

5. **Continuous Development**
   - The Company is committed to ongoing sustainable development by incorporating stakeholder perspectives into sustainability practices.

### Martin Hart-Hansen

**Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP Thailand**

"Two areas of focus come to mind when looking at ThaiBev’s potential contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals, which would also have a positive impact on ThaiBev’s business and reputation as a sustainability leader in Thailand: Sustainability of Agricultural Inputs, and Water Conservation and Management. Two major inputs into ThaiBev’s production are sugar and water, and while ThaiBev already has sustainability initiatives related to these, I would welcome an even stronger engaging in sustainability initiatives at the very primary level of the supply chain: Working with sugar cane farmers to produce sustainably, including helping farmers cope with the effects of climate change, and working with communities along major rivers to improve water quality and thereby quality of life for communities as well as the rich biodiversity in Thailand’s rivers. This is about taking responsibility for every step in the supply chain. From farm/community to consumer."

### Dr. Banthun Sethsathirot

**Deputy Director, Prime Minister Delivery Unit: PMDU**

"Regarding social and environmental issues that ThaiBev should first consider, the company can start with looking at its core business and compare it to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and see which goal it matches. Considering the business of ThaiBev, the SDG that is most relatable is Goal 12, which is about sustainable consumption and production. ThaiBev should look at its core business to see which activities match the Goal. Apart from the management and considering the value chain, ThaiBev can start doing the “Data Flow Platform” to help both public and private sectors access the data and solve the problem of data being scattered. If there is a central hub for data like this, it will help those who are involved to know about the stage of operation and development of each other. This is truly a development. If the private sector can start this initiative, the public sector would definitely join it."

# Governance, Risk, and Compliance

ThaiBev prizes integrity, accountability, transparency, and fairness, abiding by its Business Codes of Conduct. Corporate governance is one of the key factors that improve organizational efficiency involving the relations between executives, board members, management, staff, and other stakeholders. Corporate governance creates important structures acting as mechanisms to determine business objectives, to determine the methods for achieving those objectives, and to monitor operating results. Consequently, the Company emphasizes principles of good corporate governance and appropriate risk management plans following sustainable development guidelines.

Good corporate governance is an internationally recognized approach to organizational management. Consistent with the Company’s Business Codes of Conduct, good corporate governance brings about fairness and transparency, which leads to trust among shareholders and all stakeholders. Moreover, it also enables the Company to achieve sustainable growth.

## The Company’s Good Corporate Governance

With commitment and determination, ThaiBev enacts good corporate governance in tandem with an efficient, transparent, and accountable system of management. That is to say, the Company not only abides by laws and regulations, but also aims to be a role model in professionalism in doing business, prioritizing transparency and good corporate governance in order to boost confidence among shareholders, investors, staff, customers, and all stakeholders.

Furthermore, the Company has detailed its good corporate governance in the 2017 Annual Report, which explains the structures and processes of revealing information regarding good corporate governance. The Report also reveals operating results and spells out guidelines for developing organizational sustainability in the relations between board members, executives, and shareholders of the Company, for competitiveness. The Company also prioritizes business capacity building for customers, in order to foster stable and sustainable growth, and to increase value for shareholders in the long term while keeping in mind all stakeholders, both inside and outside the organization. The Company routinely organizes training in legal issues and relevant regulations pertaining to the Singapore Exchange. Every year, the corporate governance unit under the Company’s Office of the Secretary organizes an information session for board members, management, and staff from relevant units in the ThaiBev Group. And whenever there is a relevant change in laws and regulations, the unit will inform the Company in the board meeting, in the executive committee meeting, or via email, depending on the case.

# Risk Management

ThaiBev emphasizes creating and sharing the value of stable and sustainable business growth for the organization’s stakeholders. Proper risk management is essential to business operations that face uncertainty and continual change, enabling the Company to accomplish its objectives and goals. It reduces losses, increases competitiveness, and/or creates new business opportunities. The key elements of a risk management framework are as follows:

1. **Risk Management Structure and Policy**
2. **Risk Management Process**
3. **Risk Culture within the Organization**

## Risk Management Structure

The risk management structure of the Company is divided into two levels: the corporate level and the product group or business unit level.

- **At the corporate level**: 
  - The Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprises appointed directors and senior management from each product group or business unit.
  - Responsible for determining the Company’s risk management policy and framework, monitoring, reviewing, and providing comments and recommendations.

- **At the product group or business unit level**:
  - Senior executives of each product group or business unit control and track risk management and report to the RMC.

In addition to managing potential risks from normal operations, the Company also manages risks associated with strategic planning, investment, and business planning. Corporate risks are reported to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee to ensure all risks are managed according to determined measures.

## Risk Management Process

Risk management at the product group or business unit level consists of the following steps:

1. **Identify risks**: Identify risks that the Company faces or are latent in operations which could adversely affect the achievement of Company objectives.
2. **Analyze and assess risks**: Analyze the causes, likelihood of occurrence, and the possible impact or severity of identified risks to classify and prioritize existing risks.
3. **Plan action**: Plan and determine the risk management actions.
4. **Implement**: Implement the risk management action plans.
5. **Monitor, control and measure**: Track risk management progress and assess results by comparing with key risk management indicators defined as criteria for performance evaluation of middle management.

*Remark*: Following the end of the year ended 30 September 2017, the Board of Directors Meeting No. 5/2017 dated 23 November 2017 approved the transformation of the existing "RMC" to "Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (SRMC)" and the revised scope of responsibilities to ensure the Company can generate an overview of effective and efficient sustainability strategies.

# Risk Culture Within the Organization

To develop an understanding and instill risk management awareness as a part of corporate culture amongst all employees, ThaiBev regularly organizes training workshops for existing and new employees to understand the organization’s risk factors, processes of risk management and tools for managing risks, both generally and specifically. By doing so, employees will be prepared to cope with potential events affecting business operations in the short, medium and long term.

Employees can report potential risks to the organization in writing to their superiors or to the Office of the President and CEO through the dedicated email account, after which the President and CEO will consider and take further actions deemed appropriate.

# Potential Risks to The Sustainability of ThaiBev Group

According to macro-level analysis of future trends in economics, society and environment, there are 4 primary areas of change:

1. Demographic changes - population aging, growth of the middle class and urbanization
2. Climate change
3. Technological changes and increasing dependence on technologies, especially the internet
4. Shift in global economic power from the United States and Europe to Asia

Such changes could engender many kinds of risk, including risks to the economy, to corporate governance, to the environment, to safety and security, to health and to society. Together these are known as **"Emerging Risks"**, which present obstacles that may affect the attainment of business goals, the Company’s reputation and the stability and sustainability of the organization.

![Sustainability Risks Diagram](#)

- **Society**
- **Economy**
- **Corporate Governance**
- **Environment**
- **Safety and Security**
- **Health**

Therefore, the Company has come up with the following approaches to the management of emerging risks for all product groups, so as to reduce loss or adverse effects that might occur, while at the same time enhance the competitiveness of ThaiBev Group.

# Demographic Changes

## Risks and Impacts

- Consumer behavior becoming increasingly health-conscious constitutes a risk if the Company cannot adapt to consumer behavior and/or demands.
- Demands for increasingly diverse, high-quality, high-standard, or innovative goods and services among middle-income and high-income consumers, which include consumers in large cities. If the Company cannot respond promptly, it will miss and lose opportunities, competitiveness and/or market leadership.
- Increasingly strict laws and regulations concerning consumer goods or goods which affect the health of consumers leading to legal compliance risk.

ThaiBev recognizes the opportunity to improve waste management in the food businesses in Oishi Group. Accordingly, the Company has done in-depth information analysis to understand consumer behavior, and has also implemented technological solutions to create a system for restaurant operations and waste management. The system records the quantity and type of uneaten food left by consumers and identifies popular food items. The Company analyzes this information to develop a performance improvement plan to be as efficient as possible in overall service and in the use of ingredients. The Company may adjust a restaurant’s menu to better correspond to consumer preferences.

According to surveys of Oishi Eaterium and Shabushi restaurants done by an experienced survey company, 90% of consumers have increased satisfaction with the menu and services. The surveys may also help the Company choose food items which use ingredients most efficiently.

In addition, 2017 marked the beginning of the use of barcode cards and touch screens for ordering food at Oishi Eaterium. The purpose of this system is to control the amount of food customers may order each time, which is also a way for customers to help reduce food waste. The Company plans to open more branches of Oishi Eaterium in the future.

# Product Innovation

ThaiBev’s approach to new product development derives in part from the analysis of consumer feedback and behavior, gathered via channels such as social media, email, call center, as well as the results of in-depth market research and analysis. The Company takes this information to be used in product creation and development so as to better respond to consumer needs, especially young consumers who seek out new things and also prioritize products’ nutritional value.

# Responsible Consumption

Thai Beverage Public Company Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively “ThaiBev”), the world-class producer and distributor of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, aim to create high-quality products of all product groups for our consumers. As outlined in ThaiBev’s Vision 2020, ThaiBev strives to accomplish efficient growth and to diversify our market and product groups. We also guarantee brand satisfaction, while simultaneously attending to the responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages by organizing campaigns and workshops with entrepreneurs and alcohol servers to educate those directly involved with consumers on various aspects of alcoholic beverages. The purpose of the activities organized by ThaiBev is to encourage to drink responsibly, take into account their health and safety along with the safety of society. These activities include:

## Serve Responsibly Project

The Serve Responsibly Project was first introduced in 2016 with the aim to raise alcohol servers’ awareness of their responsibilities to society, emphasizing the importance of customers’ welfare and safety. To promote the responsible serving of alcohol, ThaiBev has organized the “Serve Responsibly” workshops for servers of alcoholic beverages including food and beverage service managers, waiters, and hotel and premium restaurant bartenders. The objective of these workshops is to lower the risk of accidents associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Each workshop lasts 1 day, and covers the following topics:

- **Knowledge with respect to the laws** regulating alcoholic beverages, especially the Alcohol Control Act, B.E. 2551 (A.D. 2008), and the first-hand experiences from police officers overseeing the enforcement of land traffic laws.
- **Knowledge from medical experts** to create a better understanding of appropriate alcohol consumption (Standard Drink), which would be beneficial to consumers’ health.
- **Knowledge about body reactions** before and after excessive alcohol intoxication through the “Walking Drunk” activity which participants can try out intoxication-simulating “Drunk Buster Goggles”, enabling them to identify those customers with signs of intoxication.

In 2017, ThaiBev organized three consecutive “Serve Responsibly” workshops with a total of 200 alcoholic beverage servers participating, a number that reached our set goal. Next year, ThaiBev intends to extend the workshops to Greater Bangkok and major cities in each region of Thailand. ThaiBev strongly believes that each and every workshop participant will apply the knowledge gained to their work and to share their knowledge with others, hence the production, distribution and consumption of alcoholic beverages in overall aspects shall proceed in a socially responsible manner.

- Rules and conditions for labeling and packaging.
- Penalty provisions for illegal sales and prohibited practices.

ThaiBev believes that participants will apply this knowledge in their work and foster awareness of their responsibilities to the public.

# Sustainable Sourcing

Sustainable sourcing is an essential foundation for a sustainable supply chain as it is the first step in the life cycle of ThaiBev products. This is why the Company takes great care in selecting raw materials, goods, and services used in the manufacturing process. The Company has established a **Supplier Code of Practice** in order to communicate its expectations of suppliers, such that potential production, environmental, social, and business impact is minimized. A standard for screening suppliers is also established, with strict quality control taking into account environmental and social impact. To ensure that consumers receive high-quality products, ThaiBev has standardized its sourcing process, which evidences environmental and social responsibility throughout the supply chain. In addition, sustainable sourcing contributes to job creation, increases income in local communities, and stimulates the domestic economy.

## Commercial Risk Management in Sourcing

Risk management is one of the mechanisms that propels sustainable sourcing in an efficient direction. From the selection of raw materials to the performance assessment after purchase from suppliers, risks are assessed on the basis of pricing and available supply of goods and services, as well as suppliers’ capacity in delivering goods and services. The Company identifies its critical suppliers based on sourcing risk levels and the results are brought to bear on risk mitigation strategies.

### Procurement Spend from Critical Suppliers

- **Critical suppliers contributed to 27% of the total procurement spend in 2017.**

## Categories of Suppliers

The Company classifies its suppliers by merchandise category into two groups: namely direct materials and indirect materials. The procurement spend on direct materials sourced amounts to 75% of the total procurement spend in 2017.

| Procurement Spend Proportion by Category in 2017 | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **75%**                                         | **Direct Materials**: Consists of raw materials, packaging, and fuel. This includes malt, glass bottles, plastic bottles, corrugated cartons, and fuel oils. |
| **25%**                                         | **Indirect Materials**: Consists of construction, machinery, spare parts, information technology equipment, office and factory consumables, point-of-purchase and point-of-sale products, and services. This includes filling machines, date coding machines, computers, stationery, and personal protective equipment. |

# Sustainability Risk Management in Sourcing

To ensure that suppliers meet the expectations of the Supplier Code of Practice, ThaiBev incorporates sustainability, encompassing good corporate governance, the environment, and society as part of the sustainable sourcing process. This includes screening suppliers prior to purchase and performance assessment after purchase, enhancing supply chain management efficiency to support corporate growth.

The Company has established the criteria for risk assessment which identify critical non-tier 1 suppliers, based on both business and sustainability factors. For example, their impact on the Company’s income and marketing influence, their cooperation with sustainability development efforts in the supply chain, and the frequency of sustainability risks detected.

| Non-tier 1 suppliers | Tier-1 suppliers | ThaiBev |
|----------------------|------------------|---------|
| engage in business transactions with tier-1 suppliers | directly engage in business transactions with ThaiBev | sources/procures goods and services from suppliers |

# Sourcing of High Quality and Consumer-Safe Raw Materials

Raw materials are key components in ThaiBev’s main products in the alcoholic business segment. The raw materials with the highest purchase value in procurement are molasses, malt, and broken-milled rice, all of which are used in the brewing and distilling processes. ThaiBev has established a Sustainable Agriculture Guideline to set a standard for the quality and safety of raw ingredients purchased from the Company’s suppliers, as well as for the sustainability in the agricultural sector. Such a code prioritizes the consideration of the environmental impact of agriculture, including pesticide control, water consumption efficiency, local agriculture promotion, and biodiversity conservation.

## Molasses

Molasses suppliers for the Company have been certified by Bonsucro, with a standard recognized by various groups of stakeholders in the sugarcane industry. The standard’s main objective is to reduce environmental and social impact from the production of sugarcane and in turn, the production of molasses.

## Malt

ThaiBev’s suppliers of malted barley, one of our key raw materials, are members of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform, an international organization with the objective of promoting sustainability in the agricultural sector.

## Broken-milled rice

The Company conducts strict quality inspection of broken-milled rice, especially in terms of chemical residues and extraneous materials, so as to ensure 100% safety of products.

# Procurement of Goods and Services From Local Suppliers

ThaiBev believes that a stable national economy begins with comprehensive income distribution to local communities so that they achieve self-reliance. Therefore, the Company consequently privileges suppliers operating in the vicinity of its factories. Not only does this practice contribute to local job creation and add value to raw materials in each locale, it also minimizes transportation-related pollution.

![95% of ThaiBev's suppliers are local suppliers by the year 2020](image)

## Local Suppliers and Purchase Value (2013-2017)

| Year | Local Suppliers | Local Purchase Value |

## Senior Executive Development Program (SEDP)

ThaiBev has developed this program in collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the concept of ThaiBev–NUS Global Executive Leaders Program "Realizing Vision 2020: Strategies for Sustainable ASEAN Leadership". In 2017, the aim was to develop the capabilities of 24 executives from every business unit of ThaiBev in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. The program prepares them for leadership in regional and international businesses and follows the ThaiBev Vision 2020. It emphasizes action-based learning and the need to build relationships between participants from different units for seamless future cooperation.

## ASEAN Management Development (AMD)

This collaboration between ThaiBev and C asean aims to broaden the horizons of executives by sharing experiences across cultures and discovering opportunities in expanding business to ASEAN markets. In 2017, 60 executives from ThaiBev and its subsidiaries in Thailand and Malaysia participated. The program focuses on learning, sharing experiences, understanding different languages and cultures, and exploring markets, particularly in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam. It includes presentations to CEOs of projects that can provide business growth opportunities in ASEAN markets.

## Management Development Program (MDP)

In collaboration with Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration, Chulalongkorn University, this program has been running for 3 years since 2015. In 2017, 40 middle-level executives participated, focusing on understanding administration and leadership principles to prepare them for top executive roles. Participants give presentations to CEOs and teaching employees for assessment and recommendations, readying them to apply their learning.

Every program emphasizes communication and collaboration within ThaiBev groups, consisting of employees from various agencies and areas in Thailand and overseas. The programs also focus on new creation and broadening perspectives to adapt to changes and respond to the organization's future growth.

## Example of Value Gained from Capability Development

ThaiBev monitors and measures benefits from training courses to evaluate their effectiveness. In 2017, the company expanded the utilization of the 4DX program, which began in 2015, to improve working efficiency in the Thai Beverage Logistics (TBL), a subsidiary of ThaiBev. Over 4,200 practitioners and employees were involved.

# Supporting Employee Development

The program involves coaching skills to enable supervisors to efficiently transfer and build capacity among practitioners, enhancing human capital and work development. In 2017, the 4DX program reduced operational costs by over 23.1 million Baht.

Additionally, the company invested in the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) training course, collaborating with the Science and Technology Research Institute of King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok. This initiative involved knowledge-sharing among employees from alcoholic beverage companies, focusing on reducing energy waste and costs. This saved over 52 million Baht in production costs in 2017.

## Coaching and Mentoring

ThaiBev provided the Coaching & Technique for Breakthrough Results (CTBR) training course for executives, led by Dr. Peter Chee. The course emphasizes the importance of coaching and finding solutions through inspiration. In 2017, five senior executives achieved the Master Coach and Train The Trainer levels. Currently, 550 employees have been trained, saving over 8.8 million Baht in external lecturer costs. The company aims to use this training as a KPI, encouraging supervisors to share their learning with colleagues.

# The Creation of Coaching Culture

ThaiBev created the Coaching Club in 2017 to provide an opportunity for those who passed the CTBR course to share experiences of the application of coaching in their work. Employees who are certified coaches have shared their knowledge and helped create coaching culture in a tangible way.

In addition, the Company invited Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, the world’s number 1 coach, and other internationally renowned coaches to speak to employees. To date, 890 employees have been trained.



# The Collaborative Program between Thai Beverage Logistics (TBL) and Khon Kaen University

Building on the success in the collaboration in logistics training course in 2015, which led to continuous improvement in the working process and the reduction of production cost by over 32.7 million Baht, ThaiBev continued the cooperation with Khon Kaen University in 2016 in organizing a course on logistics in 27 small programs. The programs engaged over 3,600 practitioners in regional distribution hubs in Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani and Lampang, and helped adjust work procedures to be more efficient, in terms of transport fuel, storage space and pallet renting, with the total of 11 million Baht during the reporting year. Employees will share their practical knowledge to expand the benefits to other areas.

# Strategy 5: Proactive Succession and Workforce Planning

For the purpose of smooth succession of senior executives who are close to retirement, ThaiBev has drawn up a Succession Plan to continue the vision and commitment of the Company to all stakeholders, customers, and society, and maintain a good management culture. The succession plan consists of:

1. Specifying key positions.
2. Identifying the selection criteria which include leadership characteristics suitable for key positions.
3. Assessing the readiness of the executives to be promoted.
4. Creating individual development plans and regular monitoring.

The succession plan not only takes into consideration the organization’s current needs, but also future requirements.

ThaiBev has taken various approaches in recruiting employees, such as organizing Job Fair activities in over 30 government and university premises around the country in 2017.

Moreover, ThaiBev has reviewed its hiring procedure regularly to recruit applicants with abilities and experience that match the Company’s needs. The Company also trains the interviewers to be able to create a positive image for the Company and have good relations with the interviewees. At the same time, ThaiBev encourages current employees to recommend qualified applicants for available positions under the “Puen Chuan Puen” or “Friends Inviting Friends” project. Applicants will go through a normal and transparent hiring procedure and the employee who makes the recommendation will be rewarded once the recommended applicant has been hired and worked with the Company for 6 months. In 2017, 306 new employees were hired through recommendations, which accounts for 6.7% of ThaiBev group new employees.

ThaiBev also has an Internal Job Posting channel for employees to apply for internal vacancies. This provides the opportunity for employees to advance and to develop capabilities in other areas of interest to them. In 2017, over 15% of internal vacancies were filled by ThaiBev’s employees.

# Energy and Climate Change

ThaiBev cares about the impact its business operations exert on climate change. It is one of the challenges which will spark solutions that simultaneously help improve the Company and preserve the environment to remain in a stable and sustainable condition.

Climate change is another natural disaster that is intensifying by the day. Not only is it an issue close to home, it is a phenomenon that every country in the world needs to pay attention to and adapt according to the changing environment.

To keep pace with the Twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021) which adheres to the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN as a framework for national development, climate change is one of the important issues that ThaiBev cares about. This is because climate change exerts a direct impact on ThaiBev’s business operations. For example, water shortages in the dry season result in lessened yield of agricultural products, which can impact input costs, and problems might multiply if the Company does not have a good management strategy.

With determination and a clear intention to conduct business aggressively, combined with the desire to take part in climate change management, ThaiBev has initiated management of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to reduce environmental impact, save energy, and promote making the most of energy used via various projects. These include using alternative and renewable energy in the manufacturing process, modifying electrical equipment, or developing innovations to enhance energy efficiency of machinery, and so on.

# Enhancing Energy Efficiency

## Use of Renewable Energy

ThaiBev prioritizes renewable energy and has researched alternative energy use. The company has increased its use of alternative fuels by utilizing by-products from the manufacturing process as fuel for further production. Examples include biogas, distillery slop, and technical alcohol. Additionally, projects to harness solar energy in steam production have been initiated.

In 2017, 18% of all energy used by the company was renewable.

The company promotes the continual use of renewable energy. It has installed biogas production facilities at five distilleries and invested in a renewable energy plant in Kanchanaburi Province, budgeted at 798 million baht. The biomass energy will be used in two parts: as heat energy in distilleries and to produce electricity for the Provincial Electricity Authority through a cogeneration system. The plant is under construction, expected to be completed by the end of 2017, and will start producing electricity by March 2018. This pilot project may expand to other factories in the ThaiBev network, promoting the use of alternative energy.

## Steam and Electricity Generation from Biomass Fuel

- **Spirits Production**: Produces vinasse.
- **Evaporation Process**: Converts vinasse to concentrated slop (biomass fuel).
- **Incineration Process**: Generates high-pressure steam.
- **Steam Turbine**: Converts steam to electricity.
- **Provincial Electricity Authority**: Receives electricity. 

![In 2017 the Proportion of Renewable Energy Use is 18% of Total Energy Use](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

# Reducing Energy Use Through Innovation and Technology

## Engaging Employees in Waste Reduction

ThaiBev uses the frameworks "Total Quality Management" (TQM) and "Total Productive Maintenance" (TPM) where everyone takes part in management and equipment maintenance as main tools in the manufacturing process. These tools enhance business value by maximizing resource consumption efficiency, reducing manufacturing costs, and increasing customer satisfaction.

Beer Thai (1991) Public Company Limited, the first brewery in Thailand and Southeast Asia, recently received the award "TPM Excellence, Category A" from the TPM Awards Ceremony 2016, held by the Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance (JIPM). The Company follows the 8 core TPM principles to maximize efficiency and minimize loss in the manufacturing process through problem analysis tools, good maintenance practice, education, and training. This led to a reduction in waste and increased resource consumption efficiency, serving as a certification for ThaiBev's waste management quality.

# An Example of Engaging Employees in Waste Reduction in the Food Business Group

The best way to manage waste is to prevent waste from being produced in the first place. The Oishi Company, a food business under ThaiBev Group, has encouraged staff participation in waste reduction, wherein employees jointly find ways to maximize the use of all parts of a salmon as the main ingredient in developing food items, in order to reduce food waste. As a result, staff came up with 12 salmon dishes, efficiently using all parts, no matter if the dish is sushi, sashimi, temaki, teppanyaki, or fried salmon skin, among others. Apart from waste reduction, this initiative also boosted diversity in the menu, attracting more consumers. The Company has even used salmon bones as ingredients in soup to reduce food waste.

# Waste Value-Added Activities

ThaiBev recognizes the opportunity of turning waste or "by-products" into valuable products which may be used as raw materials in the agricultural and industrial sectors. This approach adds social value and reduces environmental impact. The company collaborates with the government and leading universities to maximize benefits. Examples include:

- **Nutritional Value**: Residues from alcohol production are used as livestock feed.
- **Soil Conditioner**: Vinasse from distilling processes is used in growing crops like sugarcane and cassava.

These initiatives support chemical reduction and sustainability in agriculture.

ThaiBev's recent research project, "Lightweight aggregate," is a collaboration with the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA). This material, made from incinerated industrial waste, is used in construction due to its high strength, low density, and good sound absorption. Production is expected to start in April 2018.

## Waste-to-Energy

ThaiBev adds value to manufacturing waste by generating energy. Vinasse and wastewater are used to produce biogas and biomass fuel, replacing fossil fuels in steam generation. In 2017, this process produced 24.84 million liters of energy, saving 278 million baht. A new power plant is under construction to generate electricity from biomass fuel, promoting renewable energy and reducing emissions and costs.

### Diagram Overview

- **Distillery**: Produces vinasse.
- **Evaporation**: Concentrates vinasse.
- **Biomass Incineration**: Converts vinasse to heat energy and ash.
- **Innovation**: Lightweight aggregate production.

# Responsible Waste Disposal

Even with preventive measures minimizing waste generation and waste-to-landfill, it is impossible to avoid waste generation from manufacturing for the sake of quality and safety for the consumer. Therefore, correct and legal methods of waste treatment or elimination are observed in the Company's rules, so that its business operations are accountable to the community, society, and environment.

As a result of efficient waste management in the manufacturing process, the Company in 2017 has generated total waste of 63,681 metric tons. The waste intensity (kilogram per hectoliter of finished goods), meanwhile, has decreased by 43 percent compared to the year 2014 as a base year. The details are as follows.

## Community Development Projects: Creating and Sharing Smiles to the Community with Sustainability

ThaiBev prioritizes building sustainable relationships with communities. This year, the Company continued its mission of fostering community sustainability alongside business sustainability, with an emphasis not only on bringing a variety of beneficial activities to local communities but also on local participation in brainstorming and executing development projects. Part of the work also involves creating an understanding to defuse conflicts between factories and communities, as well as to leave a long-lasting good impression on communities. These objectives are achieved under the goal that "ThaiBev Helps Create Good Communities with Smiles." This smile comes from increased happiness, stable and reliable income, and lack of destruction of oneself, others, and the environment. Under this goal, there are four categories of projects: namely, children and youth development, sustainable resource and environmental management, local job creation and economic development, and the handling of climate change.

The following table summarizes the Company's various community development projects:

The purpose is to foster model youth who take leadership roles in the development of their own community. There are 3 groups of participants:

### Youth
- Youth participants attend a Youth Camp to learn about management skills related to community development projects.
- They create their own community development projects.
- Participants establish a Youth Club integrated with school curriculum, leading to weekly gatherings.
- Successful participants are called "model youth" for developing leadership through project-based learning.

### Community Leaders
- Participants develop leadership skills through training workshops and visits to various communities.
- They participate in community forum planning for development in Bang Khu Wat.

### Employees
- ThaiBev employees undergo training workshops about community work.
- They participate in activities organized by youth and community leaders.

In its three years of operation, the student-centered Bang Khu Wat community development project has led to the creation of a local green area called "Lotus Pond Learning Center," a place for learning about growing lotuses. Additionally, the "Foster a Lotus" activity involves 50 community members from all 12 subsections of Bang Khu Wat taking a lotus home to grow and care for, participating in subsequent lotus shows and contests.

# ThaiBev and the Pracharath Policy

The government has a policy of "Public-Private Collaboration," a systematic integration between the government and various sectors, aimed at reducing inequality, developing human capital, and increasing competitiveness. The government has established 12 working groups:

1. Working Group for Innovation and Productivity Enhancement
2. Working Group for SMEs and Start-up Promotion
3. Working Group for Tourism and MICE Promotion
4. Working Group for Export and Outbound Investment Promotion
5. Working Group for S-Curve Industrial Clusters Development

The Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy (E3) is led by General Anupong Paochinda, Minister of Interior, and Mr. Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, President and CEO of ThaiBev. The primary goal is to generate income for the community, ensuring happiness through the "Pracharath" mechanism, which involves the public sector, private sector, civil society, academic sector, and the people. This collaboration aims for sustainable income in agriculture, processing, and community-based tourism.

The working group follows the principles of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's "Understand, Reach Out, Develop," emphasizing the need for understanding locals and outreach to address their needs, ensuring happiness and sustainable support for families and society.

The approach adheres to the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. It aims to develop Thailand towards a value-based economy under the Thailand 4.0 model. ThaiBev, as the private sector leader, is committed to generating income and increasing happiness sustainably.

To ensure efficiency and long-term viability, the Working Group has established "Social Enterprise" under "Pracharath Rak Samakee (The State and the People Love Harmony)" in every province, coordinating efforts across the country. The PRS Social Enterprise network has been fully established since November 2016.

# National Level Projects

In addition, Thailand’s Ministry of Interior organizes provincial committees to coordinate and drive public-private collaboration to support collaborative projects at the provincial level. These committees work with all local sectors, with the Province Governor at the core, and representatives from various provincial government units. They collaborate with the private sector, civil society, academic sector, and the people in the province to strengthen and support community businesses.

The Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy has assigned PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Company Limited to implement the "Collaboration for Our Hometowns" project. This aims to foster a new generation of community business developers in their twenties, building leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and a desire to develop their hometowns. Community business developers undergo training in management skills and community development before working in their home communities.

Throughout the past year, 76 provincial PRS Social Enterprise companies have completed over 500 projects to develop community businesses in agriculture (35%), processing (49%), and tourism (15%). These projects have generated income for 30,000 households, totaling 58 million baht.

   Developing batik products in line with the needs of the batik market of Phuket Province and 10 southern provinces by adding batik onto other things like bags, and designing patterns that meet market demand. As well, the project connects and shares knowledge between the batik groups of 10 southern provinces through the organizing of Batik Design Week 2016 by which the batik groups of 10 southern provinces generated more than 1,900,000 baht in income. In 2017, connections were made between batik groups from 31 communities and the Hotels Association and the Tourist Business Association, in order to create sales channels for community products, resulting in a 24 million baht increase in revenue for communities.

## Examples from the Community-Based Tourism Category

1. **Rare Snacks Community along Khlong Nong Bua, Chanthaburi Province**  
   PRS Social Enterprise (Chanthaburi) Company Limited, in cooperation with the Office of Community Development of Chanthaburi Province, sponsors and pushes for an exhibition project and community market "This Helping Thai is How Thais Can Smile." This project is aimed at raising the standards of the community market to be a model worthy of trust from the people, as well as creating opportunities for producers and small farmers with more sales channels. The Rare Snacks Community along Khlong Nong Bua is a historic community that has retained its identity for more than 100 years. Consisting of historic houses on both sides of the street, the community sells traditional foods and delicious traditional desserts that are hard to find nowadays. For example: kanom tit Rho (purple sticky rice dumplings) and hanom hua lan (mung bean dumplings), which have already become a selling point for tourists. Throughout the project’s first year, no less than 240,000 baht per month in income has been generated for the community.

2. **Dhamma Mileage Travel in Sap Si Thong, Chaiyaphum Province**  
   Sap Si Thong District is one of four districts located around Lanka Mountain, a place with natural beauty, ways of life worth studying, and a community with ancient cultural traditions. It also has places for meditation, which are the heart and soul of the community. Therefore, the Working Group has sponsored and pushed for Sap Si Thong to become a Chaiyaphum tourist attraction through promotional activities and connections with various parties. The generated income from promoting community-based tourism in Sap Si Thong District, together with the sale of agricultural products in the area, equals an increase in revenue of 50,000 baht each month.

Revenue has increased by almost 8 times per visiting tourist. In addition, this led to the renovation of the entryway to the site, an online webpage for the group, connections to handicraft groups close to the village who were brought in to produce souvenirs, and other internal administrative arrangements. Income generated for the community totaled more than 290,000 baht.

### Comparison of Revenue from Sale of King Cobra Show Tickets (in baht)

| Year | July     | August   | September |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 2016 | 66,614   | 57,254   | 47,967    |
| 2017 | 112,180  | 103,500  | 76,373    |

In addition to the work in these three categories, the Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy (E3) and ThaiBev organized another project: One Tambon One Product Junior (OTOP Junior). A collaboration between the work of the Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy (E3) and the Working Group for Basic Education and Leadership Development (E5), OTOP Junior has the objective of improving learning achievements by a child-centered educational method and hands-on practice of occupational activities in line with the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. This elevates the OTOP Junior products from the children’s creativity into real value in the marketplace. By incorporating lessons about household bookkeeping and project accounting, the project hopes to build fiscal responsibility and generate an income for the children and their families, ultimately strengthening the foundations for developing quality of life and fostering resilience so that students grow up to be quality citizens and be of value to society.

# Education Development

Education is a foundation of sustainable development. ThaiBev is committed to building a society of collaborative learning through various projects and activities in the organization, in communities and at various educational institutions, consistent with the Quality Education goal of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## Scholarship Program

ThaiBev is not only committed to being a leading beverage producer but is also focused on the most important and fundamental issue, child and youth education, which is the first step toward personal development and the improvement of society and the country. For this reason, ThaiBev established a scholarship fund for children of employees in 2010, to promote and support educational advancement for children of employees who have good academic performance, as well as to help alleviate costs for their parents. The Company has offered the scholarship on two separate occasions: first, scholarships for primary education until high vocational certificate, given in August 2017; second, scholarships for university-level education and special-case scholarships (White Elephant Program), given in September 2017.

In 2017, the children of employees received 1,123 scholarships and 10 special scholarships from the White Elephant Program. From 2010 to this year, 8,169 scholarships have been granted, totaling 50,538,000 baht. In addition, since 2011, 21 awardees of the scholarship from the White Elephant Program or the general program have joined the ThaiBev workforce.

The Company will continue to be committed to sponsoring the education of children of employees, so that they grow into strong and dependable adults with a solid educational foundation.

## Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project

Is a project in which ThaiBev helps create occupational opportunities for remote communities, working together with teachers that have received the Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teacher Prize granted by 3 agencies: the Office of Non-Formal and Informal Education, the Border Police Headquarters and the Office of the Basic Education Commission. Five years after the prize was first introduced in 2013, the project has initiated various activities that encompass aspects of quality of life and the environment. These activities raise awareness among community members about the importance of having an occupation that enables self-reliance as well as forest conservation. For example:

1. **Beekeeping to Preserve the Forest Project**: with ThaiBev’s support, the community creates honeycomb-like rectangular boxes, and then hangs or places them in the community forest area of around 2,000 rai, in order to lure in queen bees to come live and nest in the honeycomb box. The bees then produce honey when the time comes. Beekeeper groups have generated more income the past 2 years, while at the same time contributed to forest conservation as part of the conservation of watershed areas, which are a major water source in the country.

# 2. "Growing Coffee following the '3 Types of Forest, 4 Types of Use' Concept" Project

Because coffee is a plant that likes a cool environment, if planted under the shade of large trees, it will produce coffee with high quality, intense flavor, and more aroma than coffee planted in fields. Members of the community therefore gathered to plant Arabica coffee in 12 rai of community forest area and received coffee hulling machine from ThaiBev, in order to serve community members and increase the coffee’s value for them to earn more, as well as be part of the conservation of 2,000 rai of forest.

## Extra Courses for Careers with ThaiBev

A project where ThaiBev organizes various courses to meet the needs of remote communities. The "Extra Courses for Careers with ThaiBev" project is important for communities to have occupations and income and lays the foundation for real community stability. This results in the conservation of watershed forests, which are an important resource for natural water production for the country, and the building of cooperation with the government and communities and to make ThaiBev’s programs for society well known among community members. This project encompasses courses on cutting men and women’s hair, sewing courses, cooking and baking courses, motorcycle maintenance courses, and courses on recycling goods for use in household agriculture. The project selects communities that are appropriate, prepared, and have sufficient time and interest in the project. Workshops are arranged in remote communities to solve the problem of educational inequality and once the participants successfully finish the course, they are provided with necessary equipment and receive periodic follow-up.

# Thai Long Boat Racing "One Focus, One Victory"

Our commitment to supporting Thai traditional sports for more than 30 years.

## Continuing the Thai long boat tradition, part of the cultural heritage of the Mekong

Long boat racing is both a cultural heritage of the river and a sport that reflects the village way of life and the relationship Thai people have had with water since the Ayutthaya period. Boats and the village way of life are part and parcel of the relationship between communities along the river basin and the life-sustaining river, a relationship in which villagers harmoniously take care of the river. This is consistent with ThaiBev’s approach to business, which is similarly dependent upon water, and is the origin of the concept “One Focus, One Victory.” The Company has lent its support to long boat racing for more than 30 years, including the long boat team “Mekong First Ship,” a team from the area surrounding a company factory.

## The Newest Generation of Long Boat Commentators Project

In the past year, ThaiBev initiated the “The Newest Generation of Long Boat Commentators” project, with the foresight that race commentators are an important element of long boat racing. They help add color and flavor into the event for the audience on both river banks, effectively the charm of the race. This profession should also be preserved and passed on to future generations. In addition, the project helps develop children who belong to these new generations. More than 10 Thai youth participants have qualified for further development into becoming professional commentators.

# Volleyball

## Success from Sustainable Development Guidelines

ThaiBev has been a sponsor of the Thai Volleyball Association for more than 30 years, making the association capable of systematically implementing a development plan for the continual success of volleyball players on the national and global level, as well as capable of winning the hearts of the people and pushing the new generation to become through-and-through professional volleyball players.

# Snooker

## SangSom 6 Red World Championship

ThaiBev sponsors and promotes snooker 6 red in Thailand, which has sparked a trend of popular interest and culminated in the SangSom 6 Red World Championship, which has been held for more than 10 years and boosted the 6 red snooker phenomenon in Thailand. Thai audiences can be proud of the snooker 6 red tournament, which has been proposed for inclusion at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. In addition, ThaiBev continues to support the world-class snooker players from Thailand, such as: Tong Sitchoi (James Wattana), formerly the third ranked snooker player in world, and Thepchaiya Un-Nooh (F Nakhon Nayok), World Champion of the SangSom 6 Red World Championship 2015.

# Castle 12 Race – a stage for local youth racers to maintain social order

“Castle 12” is a cooperative project between ThaiBev and Buriram Province which has operated for 3 years, to organize the space and set the rules for motorcycle speed races for youth racers for free. It aims to reduce the number of accidents and violent incidents among local youth, and to give youth knowledge about the rules and regulations of proper driving. Meanwhile, the project creates opportunities for learning about maintenance and how to compete in a professional manner, all with experienced professionals.

# Independent Assurance Statement

## LRQA Assurance Statement

Relating to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for the financial year 2017 (1 October 2016 – 30 September 2017)

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.

### Terms of Engagement

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev) to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report for the financial year 2017 (the Report) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s verification approach. LRQA’s verification approach is based on current best practice and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) - Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Reliability of performance data and processes defined in ISAE3000.

Our assurance engagement covered ThaiBev’s operations and activities in Thailand, including its subsidiary companies and specifically the following requirements:

- Looking at how ThaiBev has used the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, 2016 to prepare this Report; especially whether they have followed the Universal standard for:
  - Stakeholder inclusiveness and Materiality reporting principles
  - GRI 102-18 Governance Structure.
- Evaluating the reliability of data and information for the following topic specific standards:
  - **Economic:**
    - GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed (Revenues, operating costs and community investment only)
  - **Environmental:**
    - GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization
    - GRI 305-1 Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions
    - GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions
    - GRI 303-1 Total water withdrawal by source
    - GRI 303-3 Water recycled and reused
    - GRI 306-1 Water discharge by quality and destination
  - **Social:**
    - GRI 403-2 Types of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, absenteeism and number of work-related fatalities
    - GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee
    - GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews
    - GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs.

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s operations and activities outside of Thailand.

LRQA’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

### LRQA’s Opinion

Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information for the selected topic specific standards
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the Verifier.

*Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.*

### LRQA’s Approach

LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with LRQA’s Report Verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Reviewing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement and determining material issues to confirm that this information had been used to prepare their Report. We did this by comparing reports written by ThaiBev’s peers to establish whether the majority of sector issues were included in this Report.

# Lloyd's Register LRQA

- **Checking Compliance**: Verified if ThaiBev followed GRI’s Universal Standard for disclosing their Governance Structure, confirming sustainable development is part of senior management's responsibility.
- **Data Management Audit**: Reviewed ThaiBev’s data management systems for errors, omissions, or misstatements by assessing data handling processes and systems.
- **Evidence Sampling**: Conducted at:
  - Non-alcoholic beverage plant (Oishi Trading Co., Ltd., Navanakorn, Pathum Thani)
  - Spirits plant (Sura Bangyikhan Co., Ltd., Pathum Thani)
  - Beer plant (Beer Thip Brewery (1991) Co., Ltd., Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya)
  - Note: LRQA did not verify data back to original sources or assess data accuracy and completeness.

## Observations

Further observations and findings:

- **Inclusivity**: No key stakeholder groups were excluded from ThaiBev’s stakeholder engagement process.
- **Materiality**: ThaiBev identifies and determines material issues, considering stakeholder concerns and legal compliance. No major issues were excluded, but future reports should address circular economy, road waste, natural resource stewardship, and Occupational Health and Safety.
- **Responsiveness**: ThaiBev has processes for responding to stakeholders. It should expand campaigns to raise awareness about alcohol effects.
- **Reliability**: ThaiBev uses spreadsheets and manual systems for data collection. It should verify data management systems to improve reliability and ensure consistent reporting, e.g., water discharge.

## LRQA’s Competence and Independence

LRQA ensures assessments are conducted by qualified individuals. Verification is reviewed internally to ensure rigor and transparency. This verification is the only work undertaken by LRQA for ThaiBev, ensuring independence.
