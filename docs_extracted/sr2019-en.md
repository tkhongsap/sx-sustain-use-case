# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited  
Sustainability Report 2019

2019 was another successful year for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (“ThaiBev”). ThaiBev became the first ASEAN beverage company to be ranked as the Global Beverage Industry Leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for a second consecutive year, while retaining its place in the DJSI World Index for a third consecutive year and Emerging Markets Index for a fourth consecutive year. This reflects our progress towards fulfilling our goal of becoming a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader.

ThaiBev’s Vision 2020, which emphasizes the five pillars of Growth, Diversity, Brands, Reach, and Professionalism, has continued to guide us to become a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader. I am proud to say that with several landmark acquisitions across Southeast Asia and through the tremendous dedication of all our staff, ThaiBev is on track to achieve this goal. ThaiBev has grown from a Thai company to become a regional leader, with a diversified revenue stream and product portfolio, and group synergy.

ThaiBev is inspired by our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (“SEP”), and our effort is guided by His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun’s first royal pronouncement that His Majesty is determined to preserve, sustain, and enhance this legacy. The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) have also helped frame our goals. The SEP principles and the SDG targets have enabled us to take meaningful actions to help address the world’s most pressing environmental, social, and economic challenges as outlined by the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the strategic level, ThaiBev has started harnessing our own potential to develop business solutions that enhance our positive—and mitigate our negative—impact on the SDGs.

With such expansion comes increased responsibility and accountability to ensure that ThaiBev continues to contribute positively to the environment and society. That is why during the implementation of Vision 2020, ThaiBev has invested both financial and human capital into “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth” with our stakeholders throughout our value chain. ThaiBev remains committed to protecting the environment as ThaiBev believes that a healthy environment is the foundation for a strong community and society—and consequently forms the foundation for businesses to prosper. Thus, ThaiBev conducts several initiatives to reduce our impacts on the environment. In addition, ThaiBev continues to assess risks to our business that could result from climate change. ThaiBev performed environmental sustainability assessments to identify and mitigate risks from potential natural disasters and to identify areas at risk for water scarcity. ThaiBev also established the Sustainability Academy to further align and embed sustainability within the organization, and in 2019, ThaiBev became a member of the UN Global Compact, further cementing our commitment in developing a sustainable future for all.

ThaiBev is proud to have its roots in Thailand, and ThaiBev continues to drive many programs that help Thai people improve their income and wellbeing, and also preserve the Thai arts and culture heritage. This year marked the 20th anniversary of our “ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold” project, in which ThaiBev provides blankets to those living in rural areas with severe weather. ThaiBev continues to support the Pracharath Rak Samakkee public-private community partnership program, which is focused on enhancing the economic opportunities and living standards of grassroots communities. Meanwhile, the ThaiBev Thai Talent program continues to inspire and support talented Thai youths to excel. ThaiBev is also excited by the ongoing success of several other initiatives, such as ThaiBev’s award-winning WIN WIN WAR program, in which aspiring social business entrepreneurs share best business practices and ideas; and the inaugural launch of Bangkok Art Biennale this year, which was praised by BBC as an important contribution to enhancing Bangkok as a major creativity hub.

As we wrap up Vision 2020, ThaiBev plans to further expand our sustainability efforts in order to ensure ThaiBev remains a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader in the total beverage business. ThaiBev also looks forward to 2020 as it marks the start of our journey towards Vision 2025. On behalf of all the executives, I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, and all stakeholders for supporting ThaiBev in achieving our vision.

# Sourcing

As a leading national beverage producer, the sourcing process must be efficient, transparent, and committed to achieving results that maintain the quality of products and services, by considering the following factors:

- Giving priority to developing the potential business partners or suppliers to achieve goals and mutual sustainable growth with the company. A code of practice for suppliers has been established, and risk management mechanisms have been put in place for products and services, together with managing and assessing performance to make sure that they meet appropriate standards and management processes.
- Sourcing processes to standards that consider environmental and social factors such as water management, occupational health and safety, as well as providing oversight to ensure that quality and safe products and services will reach consumers.
- Considering the impact of post-consumption such as using bioPET bottles for Chang Mineral Water, which is made from 30 percent plant-based materials.
- Use modern technology in managing and planning product distribution and transportation systems, such as ensuring driving discipline so that it is safe for drivers, and efficiently manage the use of fuel.
- Expand logistics services to customers in the restaurant segment in Thailand. Last year, the company took a shareholding in HAVI Logistics (Thailand) Co., Ltd, an expert in Cold Chain temperature-controlled transportation.

# Production

ThaiBev gives priority to every stage of production, including:

- Controlling the quality of products to be correctly in line with legal requirements and various international management standards covering the environment, safety, and consumer health, such ISO 9001, GMP, HACCP, ISO 14001, and the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) drinking water standard.
- Production safety, which involves good hygiene management, only choosing quality raw materials which are safe and bring about the highest consumer satisfaction.
- Using various resources such as water and energy to get the greatest value and bring the most benefits without creating pollution. Alternative energy sources are used, such as steam for distilleries, anaerobic waste treatment systems installation, as well as once through boilers, while various innovations and technology continue to be developed.

# Distribution

With an efficient product distribution process, alongside strong distribution channels that span across Thailand, ThaiBev is able to:

- Maintain and deliver the highest quality products to all customers; while maintaining good relationships with business partners, as well as meet the needs of distributors with professional levels of services.

# Marketing and Sales

ThaiBev delivers products to consumers through efficient distribution channels by:

- Creating a strong network and building good relationships with customers through a variety of projects such as Triple A Project and marketing activities in its distribution channels, which is a strategy for efficient growth according to Vision 2020.
- Communicating and publicizing responsibility to consumers and society through the “Serve Responsibly” project and holding sales promotions that create good relationships with consumers, as well as listening to consumers’ opinions through various communications channels, which are then used to develop and respond to customers’ needs as much as possible.

# Post-consumption Packaging Management

ThaiBev believes that good packaging should not only protect the product and make it look pleasing, but should also be reusable, so the company aims to:

- Reuse packaging materials such as corrugated cartons and carton box partitions, glass bottles, aluminum cans and plastic crates in the manufacturing process.
- Develop packaging from materials which can be reused and recycled in the manufacturing process to reduce post-consumption waste, as “single-use” packaging creates too much trash and wastes natural resources in the manufacturing of these materials.

I'm sorry, I can't identify or provide information about people in images.

# ThaiBev Sustainability Approach

ThaiBev embraces His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), in tandem with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), to establish its sustainable development strategy. These principles are incorporated into guidelines to push forward business operations in a responsible manner for all stakeholders, environment, and society. In 2019, ThaiBev became a member of the UN Global Compact, which commits ThaiBev to conduct its business with fundamental responsibility in four areas: human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.

## Key Principles

### Moderation
- Work following one’s abilities and potential
- Avoid extremes
- Exercise financial discipline

### Knowledge
- In-depth information
- Correct understanding
- The linking together of knowledge and experience

### Prudence
- Manage risk
- Prepare for future impacts or changes

### Reasonableness
- Assess the reasons for every action affecting stakeholders
- Create real, authentic value

### Virtues
- Integrity
- Sincerity
- Diligence
- Self-awareness
- Humility

## The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP)

The SEP consists of three principles: Moderation, Reasonableness, and Prudence. Abiding by these three principles, based on the foundations of knowledge and virtue, allows the company to remain stable and sustainable through the currents of globalization and change, leading to balanced progress in all four dimensions: Environment, Society, Arts & Culture, and Economy. At the same time, with its sustainable development strategy, ThaiBev is confident that it will be able to be self-sustaining and develop limitless opportunities for business and society as a whole.

## Frameworks and Vision

The two frameworks, SEP and UN SDGs, emphasize utilizing knowledge, experience, and rationale to achieve steady growth, while reducing environmental impacts and promoting human capital development. Moreover, SEP and the UN SDGs are consistent with ThaiBev’s Vision 2020 to become “a stable and sustainable ASEAN leader”. Hence, ThaiBev prioritizes engaging and establishing good relationships with all stakeholders so that sustainable growth can be obtained for all.

ThaiBev has participated in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) Corporate Sustainability Assessment for five consecutive years, and has been listed in the DJSI Global Beverages Industry Leader for the second year running. The company is the first Asian company to be named a sustainability leader in the beverage industry, and has been listed in the DJSI World index for the third year running (2017, 2018 and 2019). It has also been listed as DJSI emerging market member for four consecutive years.

In addition, the company’s sustainability performances have developed in leaps and bounds, and it has been recognized as an Industry Mover in 2017–2018, for two years in a row. This remarkable achievement is a result of continuous effort to become a leading sustainable organization.

ThaiBev places importance on environmental issues first and foremost. However, both environmental and social issues can affect the company’s business operations; if the environment is destroyed, the community cannot survive. This will affect society as a whole and prevent business from thriving. Therefore, it is important for the environment, community and society to co-exist.

## Insights from Sustainability Experts

**Sumet Tantivejkul, PhD**  
Secretary General  
The Chaipattana Foundation

The world’s natural resources are depleting rapidly, and these natural resources must cater to a continuously growing global population. Some scholars have estimated that it would take three Earths to sustain both the consumption of and waste generated by the current global population. Therefore, responsible consumption is everyone’s duty before a world war for natural resources arises.

In the realm of business, the direction of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has shifted away from a charity approach to ongoing social contribution activities with clear impact measurements. Many organizations that previously conducted projects merely to offset their negative environmental impacts have started to expand their CSR activities towards other areas such as community and sustainable development.

To be effective in solving social issues and developing social projects, one needs to understand the “socio-geology” of each area. “Geology” refers to physical conditions of the area such as soil, water, wind, and fire. The “socio” part refers to the mindset, living conditions and the local culture. Once one is aware of the socio-geology of the area, one will need to create mutual understanding and meaningful engagement with the locals prior to proposing solutions that would create long-lasting impact.

ThaiBev, as a leading organization with an extensive business network, can be a main driving force for social responsibility and sustainable development. For example, driving for environmental protection standards, energy conservation, and Circular Economy, among others. The ultimate goal is to create “benefits and happiness” – for ThaiBev, its business partners, and Thailand as a whole. These efforts will bring pride for ThaiBev and inspire praise from society.

# Stakeholder Engagement

ThaiBev has established guidelines for appropriate stakeholder engagement, with an emphasis on continuously promoting creative engagement with all stakeholders through various activities and communication channels.

## The Process for Assessing Key Sustainability Issues

In 2019, ThaiBev assessed key sustainability issues by considering data on global trends and changes, sustainability issues of other companies in the industry (namely beverages and food) and issues in accordance with international sustainability standards. ThaiBev conducts new key sustainability issue assessments every three years, with issues being reviewed every year. The evaluation process is under the following process.

### 1. Identification of Issues
ThaiBev has organized workshops for executives and experts from all business areas to examine and determine the sustainability issues that are consistent with relevant business operations. This work involves learning about global trends and changes, sustainability issues of other companies in the industry, as well as specifying stakeholders on corporate sustainability issues.

### 2. Issue Prioritization
ThaiBev takes the identified issues and ranks them by priority through two main activities, consisting of: 
1. Workshops for ThaiBev senior executives to consider and assess the impact of sustainability issues on the organization 
2. In-depth interviews with stakeholders from all eight groups both domestically and internationally to understand the significance and potential impacts. The results of these two activities will be used to screen important issues for the sustainability of the organization.

Issues that are ranked as very important, both in the perspective of ThaiBev and its stakeholders, will be identified as the most important issues.

### 3. Validation
The Corporate Sustainability Development Working Team cross-checks the comprehensiveness of the key corporate sustainability issues, and presents the completed list to the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee for review and approval. It then presents the issues to the executive committee for final approval and implementation.

### 4. Establishment of Reporting Boundary
ThaiBev determines the scope of the reporting of all 16 key issues, based on the information collected from various agencies and most relevant stakeholder groups, for the information to be comprehensive and accurate, and in order to address the issues of interest to ThaiBev’s stakeholders.

### 5. Continuous Development
ThaiBev is committed to continuously operating under the sustainable development framework, by reviewing the organization’s key sustainability issues and annually taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives on key issues, as gathered through in-depth interviews on the development of appropriate and fair sustainability practices.

In addition, “ThaiBev Sustainability Day” is organized to create understanding and share knowledge about ThaiBev’s sustainable development to employees and stakeholders, such as business partners, customers, etc. Moreover, the Ways Of Work (WOW) Award project is organized as a platform for employees to present projects based on ideas or methods that are consistent with ThaiBev Global Values and that support sustainable corporate development or risk management for the company. Employees are encouraged to enter the competition and selected projects may ultimately be put into practice.

# Key Commitments and Achievements

ThaiBev considers "Corporate Sustainability Risks" from our sustainability materiality in three aspects: environment, society, and economy, on an annual basis. The corporate sustainability risk that has both a "high" level of business impact and opportunity, and a "high" level of impact and influence on stakeholders pose challenges that require us to find new and different ways to manage it. In this regard, the Company has initiated the Internal Sustainability Assessment by each product group in order to raise all product groups’ awareness of sustainable development and risks, and incorporate them into the operations of all product groups. Risk issues with medium or low impact are closely monitored by the respective committees and working groups. ThaiBev also assesses and monitors emerging risks that may occur in the next three to five years and to prepare suitable and timely risk management measures.

**Sustainability and Risk Culture**

Effective and efficient sustainable development and risk management will occur within an organization that instills sustainability and risk culture as part of the organization. To raise awareness among all employees about the importance of sustainability and jointly develop sustainability, including preventing, monitoring, and managing risks that may affect the sustainability of the organization, ThaiBev has determined that risk management is a part of business decisions, from strategic planning, action planning according to the organization’s strategy, budgeting, and daily operations. The Company considers the balance between risks, opportunities for business growth, and benefits for stakeholders. In addition, training and seminars are organized annually for employees to enhance their knowledge and understanding of sustainable development and continuous risk management. A “Risk Clinic” is also organized on a monthly basis for the risk coordinators of each product group or business unit to be able to consult and present various risk issues to the Corporate Risk Management Working Team, who will record those information in the organization’s risk register and report to the executives of the respective product groups or business units and the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee.



# Moving Forward

After expanding into important markets in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Myanmar, in the last two years, to ensure the business continues to grow with stability and sustainability, ThaiBev has set long-term goals for overall sustainable development and risk management as follows:

- **Applying various tools and processes for efficient risk assessment and risk management**, such as sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. This is to ensure sustainability, especially in regards to the impact of water resource challenges, as well as environmental, social, and climate issues, on ThaiBev’s business operations, both domestically and internationally. These tools will improve ThaiBev’s environmental operation strategy, management of the value chain, and the company’s reputation.

- **Defining and compiling key risk indicator metrics for early warning and monitor the likelihood of risk events.** These give the company the ability or time to address problems before they intensify.

- **Performing self-assessment of sustainability and risk management by executives and employees at the manager level upwards** to measure the level of understanding of sustainable development, the perception of risks within the organization, the application of risk management knowledge, and the success of building a culture of sustainability and risk management.



# Target for 2025

| 100% of business entities/units that adopt risk management framework, tools and processes in operations | 100% of key risk indicators of business entities/units | 100% of the management level performing sustainability and risk management self-assessment |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# Managing Environmental Impacts

ThaiBev is fully mindful of the impact that its expanding operations can have on the environment. As part of the Vision 2020 Strategy, ThaiBev has set an ambitious environmental target encompassing all aspects: water, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, effluents and waste, in order to limit potential impacts from its operations and achieve sustainable growth for all stakeholders.

# Managing Environmental Impacts

![Infographic: Managing Environmental Impacts]

- **Clean Energy**
- **Water Withdrawal**
- **Water Discharge**

## Main Raw Material

- Sugarcane
- Malt
- Rice
- Tea Leaf

ThaiBev has set forth a Corporate Water Management Policy, Environmental Policy, and Sustainability Policy as guidelines to be adhered to by all employees and management in ThaiBev and its subsidiaries. This ensures that ThaiBev’s environmental management is aligned across the Group, and is consistent with national and international laws, regulations and standards. To ensure continuous operational excellence, ThaiBev regularly performs environmental audits of its operations according to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 standards.

Such policies are reflective of ThaiBev’s commitment to managing impacts and protecting the environment for the benefit of present and future generations. At the same time, ThaiBev strives for continuous improvement across its entire value chain by implementing new technologies to improve efficiency, manage risks from operations, and identify opportunities that can deliver mutual benefits for business growth and environmental and social value.

With this in mind, ThaiBev is furthermore fully supportive of the Thai government’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, COP21, and aims to be Thailand’s industry leader in reducing GHG emissions in order to do its part in combating global climate change.

# Climate Change

Climate change is one of the most urgent global challenges, with direct impacts not only on ThaiBev’s value chain, but also the communities of which ThaiBev is a part. To address this challenge, ThaiBev is seriously assessing the risks posed by climate change to its operations and also striving to continuously minimize the company’s environmental impacts from all operations. By reducing the company’s greenhouse gas emissions and aligning company targets with Thailand’s latest science-based Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), ThaiBev’s goal is to help Thailand meet the Paris Agreement targets.



# Climate Change Workshops

ThaiBev has prioritized raising awareness about climate change in the organization. A climate strategy workshop with all business units was conducted to identify both the transition and physical risks, as well as the opportunities presented by climate change. Executives from all business units attended the workshop to brainstorm risks and opportunities.

Examples of physical risks include increasing water and other natural resource scarcity. Transitional risks are production limitations, cap and trade schemes, and fuel or carbon taxes. Each business unit then ranked these risks as per ThaiBev’s corporate risk management process. Lastly, opportunities were identified to ensure required changes could be planned for at the earliest date; opportunities included low carbon products, resource efficiency, alternative raw materials and energy, and engaging and collaborating with suppliers.

ThaiBev has already implemented schemes such as water sustainability assessment studies at two locations: Pathum Thani and Ayutthaya provinces. These evaluations of the current water sustainability situation and associated risks in these two provinces are illustrations of how ThaiBev is taking the risks and opportunities presented by climate change seriously. A further five locations are planned to undergo studies in 2020.

# Scenario Analysis

ThaiBev conducted a desktop physical risk assessment of natural hazards up to 2030 at all production sites in Thailand and overseas to better understand the physical risks and prepare for the impacts of climate change under numerous scenarios. The following natural hazards were studied: earthquakes, cyclones, wildfires, water stress, floods, landslides, extreme winds, sea level rise, and storm surge. From these identified issues, individual production sites are developing appropriate risk management and mitigation plans.

## Natural Hazards

- Cyclones
- Wild Fires
- Floods
- Storm Surge
- Water Stress
- Sea Level Rise
- Landslides
- Earthquakes
- Extreme Winds

# Emissions Reduction

ThaiBev used the Quick Environment Savings Technique (QUEST) and Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) methodologies to model new projects with associated emission reductions against numerous climate targets. ThaiBev is able to use these tools to model transitional risks such as production limitations or carbon tax.

This project was started at one spirit factory, Red Bull Distillery Samut Sakhon, and then rolled out to all other business units by analyzing their production plans and emission reduction projects. As a result, company-wide, ThaiBev is able to be fully prepared for the emission reductions required in order to meet the newest targets.

As part of the company’s recognition of opportunities from climate change, ThaiBev has commenced engaging with suppliers and business partners to reduce emissions and improve resource efficiency in order to reduce ThaiBev’s scope 3 emissions and mitigate climate change. In fiscal year 2019, ThaiBev invited suppliers to participate in the Sustainable Collaboration Award by submitting examples of the sustainability initiatives they implemented. The finalists were found to have reduced emissions in their operations by over 6,000 tCO₂e through collaborations with ThaiBev. Additionally, ThaiBev has begun developing processes to accurately account for other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope 3 emissions) and to incorporate these emissions into relevant disclosures.

# Insight

## How does Sermsuk adapt to climate change?

"As the country’s leading beverage producer, Sermsuk PLC recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2016, with support from government bodies such as the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO), the Industrial Environment Institute, the Federation of Thai Industries, Sermsuk has participated in two carbon footprint projects, which are the “Carbon Footprint for Organization (CFO) Label Project” and the “Carbon Footprint Reduction (CFR) and Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP) Label Pilot Project”. To lead these projects, Sermsuk used its factory in Pathum Thani province, with products “Crystal Drinking Water” and “est Cola carbonated soft drinks” as pilot projects.

For the Carbon Footprint Reduction (CFR) label, Sermsuk currently has a total of 16 products certified, including Crystal Drinking Water packaged in PET bottles and est Cola packaged in aluminum cans. According to TGO standards, the products to be certified must have achieved greenhouse gas emission reductions by at least two percent in the past two years. In addition, Crystal Drinking Water, one product of which Sermsuk is most proud, is the first drinking water in the country to be awarded the CFR label. For the Carbon Footprint for Product (CFP) label, the company has a total of 22 products certified, including drinking water packaged in PET bottles, soft drinks packaged in PET bottles and aluminum cans, Power Plus mineral drinks, and Rangers drinks. The assessment process includes all stages of the product life cycle. In the past year, Sermsuk has continuously expanded the project to seven other factories and further expanded to all types of its products. The company aims that by 2020, all of its products and packaging sizes will be certified with the CFP label.

The results of these carbon footprint projects have helped Sermsuk identify which activities have significant greenhouse gas emissions. This leads to improvements in the production process to reduce carbon emissions and aligns with the company’s energy conservation approach. Successfully implemented projects include the boiler fuel conversion project, the lightweight PET bottle packaging project, the reduction of aluminum can thickness project, the use of liquid sugar instead of white grain sugar project, and the changing of cooling tower to evaporation system project. These projects have resulted in significant reductions in Sermsuk’s overall greenhouse gas emissions. They can also help reduce environmental impacts in other aspects such as unused material management, water management and air pollution.

In addition, in order to increase consumer awareness of the importance of climate change and their recognition of the company’s certified products with the Carbon Footprint Reduction (CFR) label, Sermsuk has highlighted the greenhouse gas emission reductions of Crystal Drinking Water through a new communication campaign called “Meticulous in Every Step, to Serve You Best”. The campaign highlights the six standards that Crystal Drinking Water have been certified with, including the CFR label. This encourages consumers to learn about and purchase low carbon products."

## Moving Forward

ThaiBev has set climate change targets in line with Thailand’s Paris Agreement commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity by:

**14%** in all beverage businesses by 2025 with 2018 as the base year.

# Sustainable Sourcing

Procurement is the starting point of ThaiBev’s supply chain, particularly in regards to the selection of raw materials and products used in the production process. ThaiBev places high importance on sustainable sourcing while maintaining both environmental and social responsibility. The company procures its agricultural raw materials in accordance with the ThaiBev Sustainable Agriculture Guideline, as well as nationally and internationally recognized standards. 

To ensure a sustainable procurement process, ThaiBev has established the Supplier Code of Practice which outlines the pre-qualification criteria and stringent quality standards for suppliers. The Code is enforced upon 100 percent of ThaiBev’s suppliers to ensure that the products go through a standardized procurement process and demonstrate environmental and social responsibility. 

In addition, ThaiBev places great importance on risk management in the supply chain. All suppliers must together find ways to mitigate risks in order to increase transparency and effectiveness in all the processes in the supply chain. These measures are in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Article 12 which outlines the need for achieving sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources by 2030.

# Responsible Sourcing of Agricultural Raw Materials

Agricultural raw materials are the main ingredients used in ThaiBev’s production. ThaiBev is committed to sourcing high-quality agricultural raw materials in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. These raw materials are the main components of alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic beverages, and food; namely malt, sugar, palm oil, tea leaves, coffee beans, and cocoa. ThaiBev aims to source 100 percent of these materials responsibly and in compliance with applicable local or international standards by 2030.

- **ThaiBev encourages and supports malt and hops suppliers** to become active members and follow the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI), a global standard for agricultural practices.

- **ThaiBev supports large sugar producers** by applying the Bonsucro (Better Sugar Cane Initiative) international standard. This platform promotes sustainable sugarcane production throughout the entire supply chain, covering sugarcane farmers and sugar producers. Recognizing the environmental, social, and economic impacts of sugar production, Bonsucro boosts collaboration between academic groups, sugarcane farmers, and the private sector, so that the various steps of sugar production, from land inspection through the harvest period, can be more effectively monitored and made traceable.

- **ThaiBev supports large-scale palm oil producers and small-scale farmers** in the responsible and efficient production of palm oil and to be certified with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) international standards. In 2019, 100 percent of ThaiBev’s suppliers were RSPO certified factories.

- **100 percent of the tea leaves used in ThaiBev’s production of non-alcoholic beverages** are certified by the Organic Agriculture Standard issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Thailand.

# CROSS

Due to the growth and dramatic expansion of the business in the ASEAN region, ThaiBev’s supply chain has become more complex and involves increasingly diverse suppliers, which are not only ThaiBev’s direct suppliers but also the suppliers of its suppliers. In 2017, ThaiBev initiated the CROSS project with the aim of increasing supply chain visibility and raising the standard of procurement by focusing on fostering stakeholder collaboration, process re-engineering, and online connectivity. The project activities are classified into three dimensions, including the professionalization of procurement personnel, process improvement through automation and optimization, the development of new technological capabilities that allow for various systems to work in coordination, transparent data accessibility, and better data analysis.

In 2019, ThaiBev introduced the CROSS Procurement solution and connected it with the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) system. Currently, the SLCM system acts as the central interface between suppliers and ThaiBev. It is here that a supplier can register with ThaiBev, undertake their sustainability risk assessments, confirm orders, and exchange documents online. The CROSS Procurement solution will also play a role in fulfilling the procurement process: the solution instantly records the purchase of products and services that take place throughout ThaiBev’s operations. This is to ensure that procurement is fair, transparent and traceable. The solution consists of four features:

1. **CROSS Source**
   - For the selection of potential suppliers by taking into account the environmental, social, and governance dimension as well as the supplier’s capability. CROSS Source connects with the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) system and covers the entire supplier qualification processes from the Supplier Code of Practice compliance, to supplier registration, supplier screening, supplier selection, and bidding.

2. **CROSS Contract**
   - For contract creation and agreement with suppliers through a traceable and transparent system. It also covers contract compliance: managing the purchase of products in line with contractual terms.

3. **CROSS Buy**
   - For purchase order issuance to, and confirmation with the determined suppliers and for purchasing products through eCatalogs (online product catalogs).

4. **CROSS SRM (Supplier Risk Management)**
   - For suppliers’ sustainability risk assessments which cover environmental, social, and governance dimensions, and other areas such as supplier credibility, financial liquidity, operational risk and negative media coverage that may affect suppliers’ reputation. The risk input is derived from third-party databases specializing in corporate risk assessment such as the World Economic Forum, Dunn & Bradstreet, GDACS and Semantic Visions.

# ThaiBev Business Partner Award

Initiated in 2016, the Business Partner Award is a program for promoting supplier capacity-building, stimulating business competition, and spurring industry innovation. The award-winning business partners are those with excellent operational standards and are leading models for sustainable business practices for other partners. This year, over 150 business partners consisting of manufacturers and service providers participated in the award program. The participants comprise partners from various industries, such as packaging, commodities, and promotional goods.

In 2019, ThaiBev presented the Sustainable Collaboration Award, a distinctive award under the Business Partner Award program, to partners who collaborated with ThaiBev and other stakeholders in initiating projects with the aim to create a sustainable supply chain. The Business Partner Award Committee selected the winners based on the quantitative environmental, social, and governance benefits arising from the projects and the number of stakeholders gaining such benefits. This is in line with ThaiBev’s business practices that aim at “Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth for a Sustainable Future.”

One of the projects awarded in this category is the “Can 2 Can” project, which is a collaborative effort between ThaiBev and its tier 1 supplier, an aluminum can manufacturer, and non-tier 1 supplier, an aluminum sheet manufacturer. Through this project, ThaiBev and its partner have successfully created a sustainable and closed-loop packaging management system.

# ThaiBev Business Partner Conference 2019 and Thailand Supply Chain Network

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of engaging with business partners, who are crucial in steering business towards the goals of ThaiBev’s Vision 2020. The ThaiBev Business Partner Conference 2019, part of a two-day ThaiBev Sustainability Day 2019 event, was organized to communicate ThaiBev’s steady business direction, both short-term and long-term, to its partners. This helps them seize opportunities to grow steadily and sustainably with ThaiBev. The event also provides a platform for ThaiBev and its business partners to exchange insights, goals, and challenges related to consumer behavior dynamics and to keep pace with sustainable development goals.

At this year’s event, ThaiBev launched the "Thailand Supply Chain Network" (TSCN), in collaboration with its strategic business partners, aiming to establish intercorporate relations among Thai companies. Through TSCN, companies can exchange information, share experiences from their investments, and learn about operating businesses overseas. This knowledge will assist Thai entrepreneurs in strengthening their supply chain, allowing them to expand their businesses to different markets.

# Commitments and Achievements

- **Policy and standards used in the procurement of raw materials:**

  Set standards for the procurement of agricultural raw materials that are the main raw materials used in the production process, namely malt, sugar, and palm oil in accordance with internationally recognized standards such as Bonsucro, RSPO, and SEDEX to ensure that raw materials are carefully selected through socially and environmentally responsible procurement processes.

- **Business partner assessment process:**

  By performing on-site audits at suppliers’ facilities on a regular basis, particularly the Critical Suppliers including non-substitutable suppliers, high-volume suppliers as well as suppliers exposed to high risk (suppliers without adequate environmental management or whose employment practices are not in line with the universal standards). Both internal and independent verifiers take part in the audit: for instance, production process inspection, safety and hygiene in product storage, and product transportation. In addition, the audit process examines the sustainability of suppliers’ business operations, such as waste management, labor practices, employees’ occupational health and safety. The risk database from independent organizations that are internationally accepted, such as the World Economic Forum and CSR Risk Check, are also used to assess sustainability risks that cover all risk dimensions. Currently, ThaiBev has assessed 100 percent of its Critical Suppliers and high-risk suppliers.

- **Supplier engagement:**

  ThaiBev collaborates with its Critical Suppliers to assess non-tier 1 suppliers, especially the suppliers of critical materials, in order to manage end-to-end risks throughout the supply chain. ThaiBev regularly liaises with key suppliers to exchange information about risks of non-tier 1 suppliers and may assign ThaiBev’s personnel to participate in non-tier 1 supplier on-site audits alongside critical supplier auditors to properly identify and mitigate potential risks in the supply chain.

# Water Stewardship

Climate change and exponential economic growth have caused changes in water use patterns, and resulted in a greater risk of water shortages. With these potential risks in mind, ThaiBev has conducted a comprehensive water management analysis that looks at the entire value chain. ThaiBev encourages the development of innovations to maximize efficient water usage, and to control the quality of water discharged into surface water to meet quality standards. ThaiBev assesses the sustainability of water use to reduce the risks and impacts of water consumption for both the short and long term. The company has also collaborated with local communities to protect watersheds by organizing tree-planting activities and building check dams to conserve water resources.

# Surface Water and Groundwater Sustainability Assessment

ThaiBev initiated the Water Sustainability Assessment (WSA) for both surface water and groundwater, beginning with Sura Bangyikhan Co., Ltd. Pathum Thani Province in 2017, and Beer Thip Brewery (1991) Co., Ltd. Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province in 2018. The objective was to conduct an in-depth assessment of present and future water risks covering the following four areas:

1. Water Availability
2. Water Quality
3. Regulatory Changes
4. Stakeholder Perceptions

Satellite imagery is used to study watershed topography, water flow direction, drainage, slope patterns, and trends of water usage during the past ten years. This allows ThaiBev to create a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy that is appropriate for local conditions. It also allows the company to assess sustainability and implement water management plans for maximum efficiency in each production area. Plans are made for water stewardship, both in terms of quality and quantity, as ThaiBev aims to become a leader in water management practices in the beverage industry.

In 2019–2020, ThaiBev plans to conduct water sustainability assessments in five more factories to cover all of its business groups, and will expand this activity to cover all factories to ensure a sustainable business operation.

# Water Footprint

A water footprint consists of consumption data for both direct and indirect water usage for production and services throughout the supply chain. ThaiBev uses water footprint calculations to assess its water use and discharge rates, enabling the company to set water management policies to maximize the efficient use of water resources. ThaiBev is always looking for ways to reduce its water footprint by applying the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. The company considers its environmental impact, and attempts to reduce the risk of water shortages that can have a direct impact on its business. ThaiBev collaborates with its suppliers to better manage the use of water to ensure greater sustainability throughout the supply chain.

# Upstream Forest Conservation and Community Water Stewardship

ThaiBev has consistently implemented water management projects with all of its internal and external stakeholders with the goal of preserving upstream forests. The company has collaborated with local communities to conserve water resources and protect ecosystems through the following projects:

- **The Water Retention Project for Community Agriculture**  
  The ThaiBev community development team, along with employee volunteers, worked on a water retention project to support community agriculture in Na Suan Sub-district, Sri Sawat District, Kanchanaburi Province. The project helps communities retain water by digging wells in areas prone to flooding and waterlogging. These function as a water catchment area. This project is designed to reduce the problem of water erosion on hillsides, and retain soil moisture for community farming. It is part of an organic agriculture program that ThaiBev sponsors, to ensure the most efficient use of water for the community. A group of speakers from Nong NokKaeo Subdistrict Administrative Organization (SAO) in Lao Khwan District, Kanchanaburi Province, provided advice on the best well system practices and water storage procedures for the area, a demonstration of how academic knowledge can complement local knowledge to help manage water sustainability.

- **Water Conservation Program**  
  ThaiBev collaborates with communities and stakeholders involved in water use and water resource conservation, and supports local communities’ fair and equitable access to water resources. In 2019, ThaiBev implemented social and water conservation programs in six provinces across the country: namely, vetiver grass planting in Phetchaburi Province, mangrove planting in Samut Sakhon Province, constructing water retention ponds for agricultural use in Kanchanaburi Province, planting mulberry trees and constructing houses to raise silkworms in Khon Kaen Province, planting mangroves and installing bamboo sticks as a tidal erosion barrier in Chanthaburi Province and building check dams in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province.

- **Clean Drinking Water for Children**  
  ThaiBev partnered with Wat Phuet Nimit School, Wat Lat Sai School, and Wat Kudi Prasit School in Pathum Thani and Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Provinces to improve the school drinking water system. Water quality is monitored on a regular basis by collecting water samples and analyzing them at the factory’s laboratory, a facility certified by the Department of Industrial Works. The project also provides basic training about maintenance and cleaning of the water filtration system so that students always have clean, hygienic drinking water that meets quality standards. Students can also apply this knowledge at home. ThaiBev plans to extend this project to all schools in the areas surrounding the factory.

- **Weed Removal in Public Canals**  
  The spirit product group collaborated with Nakhon Chai Sri Sub-District Municipality in Nakhon Pathom Province and the local community to organize an activity called the “Weed and Water Hyacinth Removal in Public Canal Project.” This project encouraged communities to participate in addressing environmental pollution problems by removing weeds and water hyacinths in public canals in the Nakhon Chai Sri Sub-District. The project raised awareness in the community about the value of the environment, how to better protect and manage natural resources, and the importance of cleanliness.

- **Clean Water Project in Myanmar**  
  The Grand Royal Group (GRG) has launched a “Clean Water” project with the aim of improving the quality of life and wellbeing of residents in the Yangon, Mandalay, and Irrawaddy River areas, many of whom still lack access to clean and hygienic drinking water. This project can help avoid the problem of clean water shortages during a crisis or disaster.

  The GRG partnered with local authorities to build wells and water tanks for local consumption and utilization. A committee was established to maintain the projects and to educate local residents on the topic of “water treatment methods in disaster situations.”

  From April 2016 to September 2019, the GRG constructed eight wells, 16 water tanks, and five wastewater treatment facilities, serving more than 40,000 people and 6,000 households throughout Myanmar. According to a report, the project helped provide clean water to nine villages and one township in Yangon and Mandalay, and was able to reduce the health problems of 840 people caused by unclean water sources.

# Commitments and Achievements

Effective water management in 2019 resulted in the reduction, reuse, and recycling of water in the following ways:

![3Rs Diagram: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle]

## REDUCE
**8.79%**

- **The reverse osmosis center project**

# Insight

## Remote Sensing Technology for Water Management

At present, the remote sensing technology for water cycle tracking is advanced and has many applications, such as earth exploration satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ground measurement stations. This enables us to integrate more data in our reporting and analyses. The application of such technology in water management can be divided into two parts: water demand and water supply.

For **water demand**, the remote sensing technology can be applied to track the phenology from data collected by satellites with a near-infrared wavelength, such as Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or Thai Chot (THEOS), Thailand’s first satellite for earth exploration. Remote sensing can also be used to calculate evapotranspiration rates, by using data from satellites with thermal infrared bands such as Landsat, MODIS, and Suomi NPP.

For **water supply**, the remote sensing technology can be used to delineate, locate, and estimate the surface water body size. It also helps estimate the amount of precipitation using passive and active microwave sensors from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, by using Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR).

Another important variable in the water cycle is soil moisture. In the past, soil moisture levels could only be measured directly in the field. Now it can be measured and mapped using the Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite (SMAP), by analyzing the electromagnetic radiation properties of water and soil.

It is necessary that water management in the “Thailand 4.0” era be more systematic by applying various technologies, such as remote sensing technology, ground sensor networks, and the Internet of Things. Data can be analyzed in real time and with greater dimensions.

# Waste Management

ThaiBev’s waste management plan maximizes resource utilization throughout the value chain by using the principle of the 3Rs. ThaiBev encourages all stakeholders to recycle waste, reduce the amount of waste that must be disposed of, and use resources efficiently. Waste management initiatives include post-consumption packaging management, using waste products to generate energy and managing by-products. ThaiBev collaborates with other organizations to implement innovative projects to add value to waste products. The utilization of waste is in accordance with the principles of the Circular Economy, which ThaiBev uses as a guideline to conduct its business. ThaiBev recognizes its responsibility to communities, society, and the environment.

# 3Rs

- **Reduce**
- **Reuse**
- **Recycle**

## Circular Economy

- **Reduce the amount of waste**  
  that must be disposed of and  
  use resources efficiently

- **Waste to energy**
- **Post-Consumption Packaging Management**
- **Collaborating with other organizations**  
  to implement innovative projects to add value to waste product.



## Using Malt By-product for Agriculture

Malt is the primary raw material used in ThaiBev’s beer and spirit production processes. During the manufacturing process, a by-product called “malt residue” is produced. It has many nutritional benefits and is suitable for agricultural use. ThaiBev has collaborated with the Suranaree University of Technology (SUT) to pioneer the project of using malt residue as an ingredient for animal feed. SUT researchers have expertise in cattle feed nutrition, Korat Wagyu cattle-breeding, and environmentally friendly animal feed technology. By experimenting with mixtures of malt residue and dry yeast, a new formula of nutritious animal feed for cattle was developed. This new formula leads to high quality meat, increased fat content, and lower prices. It is safe to consume, in-line with market demands, and reduces environmental impacts.

In addition to the malt residue, malt dust is another leftover. ThaiBev took malt dust that would otherwise go to waste, and offered it to local farmers near one of its factories. The malt dust has high nutritional value as aquaculture feed, for varieties such as catfish and tilapia. By replacing the usual animal feed, costs were reduced by 100 percent. ThaiBev’s agricultural scholars educated and advised the farmers through the entire project. It helped the community to develop additional job opportunities, reduce aquafarming costs, increase productivity, and generate sustainable income.

# Production of Biogas from Vinasse to Generate Renewable Energy

Converting waste to energy is a waste management process that ThaiBev has consistently engaged in. To reduce the impacts of using non-renewable fossil fuels, Thai Beverage Energy Company Limited set up a project to use distillery vinasse, a by-product of alcohol production. Distillery vinasse is used to produce biogas that is sent to five distilleries in Buriram, Ubon Ratchathani, Khon Kaen, Prachin Buri, and Surat Thani provinces. The biogas is used to produce steam, which in turn can act as a substitute for fossil fuel. This project reduces the emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas. Excess biogas from steam production at the Buriram and Ubon Ratchathani facilities can generate electricity for internal use, and surplus electricity is then sold to the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).

Adding value through distillery vinasse from the alcohol production process helps create energy security for the country, and serves as an educational example for local communities. ThaiBev is expanding the project to two more distilleries in Nakhon Sawan and Nong Khai provinces. The two new projects are expected to be completed in 2021, with a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 76,000 tCO₂e annually.

# Encouraging Staff to Participate in Waste Reduction by Separating Waste in Office Buildings

To reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and promote the most efficient use of resources through the 3Rs, ThaiBev has launched a campaign to help employees realize the value of their existing resources. The company started its waste management approach by separating office waste with a project called “Collect–Return–Recycle.” The campaign creates awareness and understanding of the benefits of the waste separation process, and shows how value can be created from recyclable waste such as glass bottles, PET bottles, and aluminum cans. If employees see that there is a proper management methodology, and a path for further application of the materials, they will be able to create value and transform waste into useful raw materials. ThaiBev also collaborates with the Federation of Thai Industries’ Thailand Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE) to organize training courses for employees about waste separation in office buildings. Employees can apply this basic principle in their daily lives, and in post-consumption management.

Promoting this project and encouraging employees to participate in waste separation for the office has led to different campaigns and projects: such as reducing the use of plastic bags and foam boxes, substituting single-use plastic bags with cloth bags, and the clear organization of waste collection points in the work area. All of these efforts encourage employees to participate in waste management programs that promote environmental sustainability.

# Commitments and Achievements

In 2019, ThaiBev successfully managed to transform waste into energy through a project run by its subsidiary, Thai Beverage Energy Company Limited, whose core responsibility is to use waste from alcohol production to produce alternative energy. The overall project won the Thailand Energy Awards 2019. The following projects also won excellence awards in two categories:

1. **Outstanding 'off-grid' renewable energy project**: Thai Beverage Energy’s Khon Kaen branch produces biogas from distillery vinasse.

2. **Renewable Energy Cogeneration Project**: Thai Beverage Energy’s Buriram branch produces renewable energy from distillery vinasse.

## Insight

### "From Waste Management to Sustainability"

“Waste management for various organizations needs to be formulated into appropriate policies and plans. The application of the Circular Economy, a concept that focuses on preserving resources for maximum benefit, and recycling them for use in research or innovation to add value to waste, has allowed ThaiBev to invest in effective waste management with concrete results, and to replace old businesses, as well as to expand existing businesses to become environmentally friendly and sustainable.”

# Moving Forward

In its production of quality beverages and food, ThaiBev places great importance on consumer safety. It selects natural materials through a sourcing process that maintains product quality, and prevents the waste of various processes from affecting the environment and surrounding communities. ThaiBev complies with legal regulations for waste treatment and disposal according to international standards in order to manage waste with the highest efficiency. The following achievements were made in 2019:

### Total weight of waste and disposal method of Beverage business

| Method                          | Percentage |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Reuse                           | 36.2%      |
| Recycling                       | 0.9%       |
| Composting                      | 0.1%       |
| Recovery, including energy recovery | 4.9%   |
| Incineration (mass burn)        | 5.8%       |
| Landfill                        | 52.1%      |

**Total: 36,953.72 Metric tons**

# Eco-Friendly Packaging

Waste disposal is a global environmental problem. More than 12 million tons of non-compostable materials such as plastic are disposed into the ocean annually, damaging marine ecosystems, threatening the lives of sea creatures, and ultimately humans as well. In order to reduce the impact of increasing amounts of waste on both land and in the ocean, ThaiBev adheres to the principle of the Circular Economy in its packaging management. The main packaging materials used in the production of ThaiBev products are glass, paper, aluminum and plastic. ThaiBev recognizes the importance of innovation and product design, using environmentally friendly materials, and reusing and recycling post-consumption packaging in the manufacturing process. In addition, ThaiBev aims to reduce packaging, and promotes reuse and recycling.

# Can 2 Can Project

The objective of the Can 2 Can project is to collect used aluminum cans so that they can be recycled into aluminum sheets, which is the raw material used in beverage can production. It is a cooperative effort between ThaiBev and its direct supplier, the aluminum can manufacturer, and an indirect supplier, the aluminum sheet manufacturer. Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd. (TBR) is responsible for collecting the cans and delivering them to the aluminum sheet manufacturer. 

Since the project began in June 2019, 703 tons of cans have been retrieved. This amounts to a total of 52 million cans, which represents 14 percent of the total volume of ThaiBev products sold in Thailand. The Can 2 Can program generates income for small-scale waste collectors. It also has the potential to reduce the energy used in the can manufacturing process by up to 95 percent, compared to the use of new aluminum.

# Bottle Sorting by AI Image Recognition

This represents a transformation of the bottle sorting process using cutting-edge technology. The development is a collaboration between internal departments, including Thai Beverage Recycle Co., Ltd. (TBR), the Office of Information and Technology, BevTech Co., Ltd., and a world-leading university in computer science, technology and robotics to study the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in the TBR bottle sorting process. This project is an advanced and efficient modification to Octopus, the automatic bottle-sorting mechanism invented by ThaiBev. Instead of having humans visually inspect the bottles, AI can learn and recognize the different patterns of defects presented in used glass bottles, reducing eye muscle fatigue among employees. This new technology allows ThaiBev to deliver used glass bottles with zero risk of human error. In addition, the cost of transporting defective bottles is minimized, as well as reducing losses from rinsing bottles that are not suitable for reuse, and allows for a reduction in the number of people re-screening at the packing line. These employees will be switched to work in other areas that add more business value to the company.

# Bring Back Home

A significant amount of glass packaging is being exported from Thailand for the production of beverages in Myanmar. One of the major buyers of glass bottles is the Grand Royal Group (GRG), a leading producer and distributor of spirits in Myanmar. As there is no cullet recycling plant nor glass bottle production plant in Myanmar, glass scraps become harmful waste that poses both social and environmental threats. In an effort to resolve this problem, ThaiBev collaborated with GRG to retrieve cullet from Myanmar using reverse logistics. As a consequence, this cullet can now be handled in a responsible manner and recycled by glass bottle manufacturers.

*More information on Automatic Bottle-Sorting Mechanism can be found in ThaiBev Sustainability Report 2018*

# Narrow Neck Press and Blow (NNPB)

ThaiBev collaborates with its suppliers to create eco-friendly packaging designs and promote energy-efficient packaging production processes. In the past year, a project has been initiated to study the Narrow Neck Press and Blow (NNPB) process in the manufacturing of large clear glass bottles. This technology allows the manufacturing of large-size lightweight bottles, requiring less resources and energy, while maintaining the same levels of durability.

# Energy Management

ThaiBev embraces initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, focus on energy efficiency, and use resources sustainably. The goal is to increase the use of alternative and environmentally friendly energy. Today, due to the consumption of fossil fuels and the extreme accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global temperatures are rising. ThaiBev therefore has made technological changes in its production process to use renewable energy as the main source of energy. Awareness is also being raised among employees to make them understand the importance of the environment and society, inspiring them to better support the company’s green projects, such as the use of solar cells and the application of by-products from production processes as alternative energy sources.

# ThaiBev Energy Audit Project

A company-wide project to assess the energy consumption of each production process and identify opportunities for energy efficiency. The project has enabled distilleries to reduce energy consumption by applying new technology. For example, beer and spirit product groups installed once-through boilers to increase energy efficiency and reduce the use of non-renewable fossil fuels. The beer product group cut its use of coal by 428 tons per year, resulting in a reduction of 702 tCO₂e emissions per year. The spirit product group was able to lower fuel oil consumption by 280,823 liters per year, which decreased greenhouse gas emissions by 836 tCO₂e per year. In addition, the beer product group has introduced the use of high-efficiency motors, which reduced electricity consumption by 150,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) per year, and reduced emissions by 87.3 tCO₂e per year.

# Rooftop Solar Cell Installation

This project consists of the installation of solar panels on the rooftops of 27 factories in Thailand, and one factory in Myanmar. The installation will be completed by 2025, with a total capacity of 20 megawatts (MWp). It is projected to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from the Provincial Electricity Authority by 26,000 megawatt hours (MWh) per year, and lower greenhouse gas emissions by 12,000 tCO₂e per year. It is expected that the project will reduce the cost of electricity purchased from the Provincial Electricity Authority by 96,200,000 baht.

# Biogas Plant Installation Project

Two additional biogas plants will be constructed in Nakhon Sawan and Nong Khai provinces, in addition to the five existing biogas plants in Prachin Buri, Khon Kaen, Ubon Ratchathani, Buriram, and Surat Thani provinces. The biogas plants use the by-products of alcohol distillation to generate energy. Vinasse, a by-product of the spirit distillery process, produces methane as a fuel for steam production, and can also be used to generate electricity. This can reduce average annual fuel oil consumption by 2 million liters per factory per year, and lower greenhouse gas emissions by 38,000 tCO₂e per factory per year. The electricity produced from biogas can be transmitted back to the grid.

# Insight

## What is the current plan for alternative energy use and greenhouse gas reductions?

“At present, the beer group plans to reduce energy consumption along with greenhouse gas emissions to comply with ThaiBev’s targets for 2025. The use of renewable energy will increase. Budgets have been allocated for replacing fossil-fuel based electricity with solar energy. We currently use biogas from the wastewater treatment system to replace the use of fossil fuels, through the installation of a once-through boiler. The group plans for future energy use to be sustainable. Energy consumption will decrease by modifying equipment for higher efficiency and lower power requirements. Efforts are underway to increase production efficiency by capturing carbon dioxide from fermentation to be reused in the production process (CO₂ Recovery Plant). This can help lower electricity consumption, and also allow for the reuse of carbon dioxide in the production process that otherwise would be released during fermentation. The most important plan is to train employees and encourage them to participate in energy efficiency initiatives for maximum impact.

Within the beer group, a campaign has been launched to reduce and/or eliminate the use of plastic in factories, especially plastic straws, foam boxes, and products containing OXO-degradable or microbeads. Data has been collected and progress on this front is monitored continuously.”

# Caring and Sharing, Creating Values for Society

Thailand faces many of the same social challenges as the rest of the world, especially when it comes to the issue of equality. Rising income inequality and unequal access to the best healthcare and educational resources, among other disparities, make it imperative that ThaiBev contributes to creating more balance in society. Thus ThaiBev’s corporate social responsibility programs are extremely wide-ranging, covering the entirety of Thailand, crossing several demographics from youth to the elderly, and focusing on five key dimensions. 

Following the results of a survey taken several years ago to determine how ThaiBev could maximize its impact, these dimensions are defined as:

1. Education
2. Public Health
3. Sports
4. Arts and Culture
5. Community and Social Development

ThaiBev makes substantial contributions to each of these to empower all people across society to have a chance to reach their potential, following its motto “ThaiBev... Always With You”.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited  
Sustainability Report 2019

## In 2019, ThaiBev allocated a budget of 500 million baht to these five key areas as follows:

| Education | Public Health | Sports | Arts and Culture | Community and Social Development |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 21%       | 7%            | 42%    | 13%              | 17%                              |

ThaiBev’s efforts cover a wide range of initiatives from supporting the purchase of medical equipment to providing scholarships, to promoting clean water, to reforestation, to raising local incomes through community-based social enterprise projects. ThaiBev has always been a staunch supporter of the arts as well, viewing the cultural fabric of a society as an important factor to maintain. Through its support for these five dimensions, ThaiBev aims to fulfill its organizational aim to “Share the Value of Growth” with all its stakeholders and thereby also create a stable and sustainable environment for its business.

To achieve social responsibility, ThaiBev has created a governance structure that can support short-term, medium-term and long-term projects. Led by the President and CEO, the programs in each of the five dimensions are guided by senior-level executives. Under this governance structure, directors and employees are encouraged to undertake volunteer activities and public charity in all forms, and there are many working groups to pursue various community development projects. These efforts are divided into two parts which are:

1. **At Corporate Level**, these comprise the department of Community Development Programs; the group of enhancing quality of life and the environment; external affairs group; Thai Talent project group; the group supporting arts and culture; the group from Human Resources; and the group from Corporate Communications.

2. **At Local Level**, around a factory, these comprise public relations and environmental groups in each factory, which work in coordination with the corporate level. Each agency coordinates and operates projects it has initiated, or cooperates with various groups in society.

These community development programs provide 100 percent coverage of ThaiBev operations that may have direct or indirect impacts on the surrounding communities.

Initiating projects and activities to benefit local communities, society and the environment, ThaiBev abides by the following operating procedures:

- It regularly assesses social and environmental impacts by creating relationships and inquiring about the opinions or needs of the target community, including those in the area around the factory, around any facility or communities close to the company’s products. This is done using questionnaires, through interviews and public meetings, and by communicating with community leaders, parents’ groups, school boards or through small weekly informal meetings.

- Every project must have concrete measures to assess the results; by evaluating the satisfaction of the community and stakeholders, social and environmental impacts, and follow-up reports from the relevant bodies such as government agencies, universities and civil society groups.

ThaiBev has collaborated with communities and local bodies to establish an occupational health and safety committee, local community consultation committee as well as groups of personnel tasked with handling complaints and monitoring operational impacts. Such groups include public relations and teams of environmental specialists, who are required to constantly monitor and report their findings in order to ensure that ThaiBev’s corporate social responsibility initiatives fulfill the needs of communities and help to create sustainable societies.

# Education Development

ThaiBev believes that the development of knowledge and the enhancement of human resources play a critical role in advancing sustainable development and improving quality of life. Over the past years, ThaiBev has supported education for children and youth through many types of projects, such as scholarships, promotion of knowledge and business skill. ThaiBev hopes that everyone will be able to develop oneself and contribute to improving society and the country. Furthermore, ThaiBev continues to provide scholarships to employees and their children in order to reinforce their capabilities and to promote employee welfare.

# Scholarship Fund for Children of Employees

Because children mean everything to parents, ThaiBev is committed to helping them as part of employee welfare. The company considers it very important to provide educational support through scholarship funds from primary education through university levels for employees’ children who have strong academic performance, in order to help the parents with their children’s educational costs. The employees who are eligible must work at the operation level and have good or excellent working performance, while their children must have good behavioral and academic records.

In addition, ThaiBev’s “White Elephant Scholarship” is awarded to employees’ children who have outstanding academic records at university level. Over the past 10 years (from 2010 to 2019), ThaiBev awarded more than 10,300 scholarships worth over 64 million baht. In 2019, employees’ children received 1,112 scholarships worth 6,891,000 baht.

In addition to awarding scholarships, ThaiBev also considers accepting employees’ children to join its workforce. Currently, there are 40 employees that previously received scholarships from ThaiBev and are now working with the company. This includes 10 employees working in Route-to-Market group, 12 employees in the Spirit group, three employees in the Beer group, two employees in the finance and accounting group, 11 employees in the supply chain management, one employee in the internal audit office and one employee in an affiliated company.

**Question:** As a university mentor for the Mahachai Pittayakarn School in Maha Sarakham, in your opinion, how do the students benefit from the "Tham Ma Kha Khai" project of raising chickens for organic egg production?

**Answer:**  
"There are so many benefits. First, students have better-quality lunches and can earn an income from it. Second, students who do not continue their university education will have a career and will not be a burden on society."

## The OTOP JUNIOR Contest

- The project "Tham Ma Kha Khai" receives cooperation from the Community Development Department under the Ministry of Interior.
- The contest is well-known online, with a Facebook page having 2,373 followers.
- It provides opportunities for fourth-year elementary and third-year high school students to present unique products reflecting local identities.
- The OTOP JUNIOR contest offers a platform for students from participating schools to showcase their talent.
- Over two years, more than 600 contestant groups from schools nationwide participated.
- 20 groups reached the final round, receiving awards worth more than 500,000 baht.
- Students can exhibit and sell their products in OTOP City events and join business-perspective activities.
- They also participated in the "Walk Rally" to exchange ideas with Young OTOP entrepreneurs and broaden their experiences through field trips.

# Opportunities for Children with Special Needs

The simulated business project “Tham Ma Kha Khai” was also implemented in seven special children schools in six provinces, including Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Nakhon Sawan, Phitsanulok, Ubon Ratchathani, and Songkhla. Classes and trainings with special needs for more than 200 children to teach them to better concentrate and develop arm muscles through bas-relief art and the production of coconut lamps.

The teachers took the children to learn production methods directly from business owners. Each student completes different components of the finished product; then assembles the finished product as a group. Currently, there are several products made by special children, such as key chains, coconut lamps, and herbal balm. Although there are limitations in the presentation of the products, these children also get a chance to join the OTOP JUNIOR contest with other schools and receive an opportunity to win "inspiration awards" in order to give them inspiration and confidence.

# Partnership School Project

ThaiBev has joined the Ministry of Educational in driving education reform in accordance with the “Thailand 4.0” policy. The objectives are to build cooperation between the private sector, civil society and other sectors in order to improve school management and curriculum development so that it better suits the needs of local communities and builds the skills for children. ThaiBev was one of the private companies that participated in the management of 19 schools in 13 provinces during the 2018 academic year. In the 2019 academic year, ThaiBev supported four additional schools in two more provinces and collaborated with the Mechai Viravaidya Foundation, one of the initiators of this project, to strengthen and drive the project forward for a period of three years or until 2021.

# Insight

## The conference to summarize the guidelines of teaching development and life skills under the "Tham Ma Kha Khai" project of Pracharath School project and Partnership Schools in the southern region on March 13, 2019 at Haad Kaew Resort, Songkhla Province.

"ThaiBev has been contributing to the simulated business project "Tham Ma Kha Khai" which is one of the important projects to use education to sustainably strengthen the economy and society. It is like a starting point to develop people to be skillful, and to have knowledge to create wellbeing and prosperity for families and communities. The Ministry of Education is committed to provide education to develop children, youth, and the general public in order to meet the needs of different areas of the country and be in line with Thailand’s 20-year national strategy. The Ministry of Education has followed the “Understand, Achieve and Develop” strategy from His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great (Rama IX) and incorporated the guidance of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua (Rama X) regarding education.

1. First is having the right attitudes towards the country and adhering to the institutions of the nation, religion and monarchy.
2. Second is having a stable life with morality and ethics.
3. Third is to have a decent job.
4. Fourth is to be a good citizen.

There are four foundations for education. These four foundations create the education-building concept for opportunity and reduce the differences in economy and society in the long term.

Thank you to Thai Beverage Public Co., Ltd. for its commitment in supporting children and youth development as well as boosting the economy at the community level."



## Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project

ThaiBev has been promoting the Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project continuously for seven years. From the 5th through to the 11th year of the project, more than 70 schools have been involved. The awards for social and environmental development projects are divided into two categories: awards for teachers in the current year and for teachers who have been recognized in the past. This year, Mr. Suthep Praith who participated in the fifth year of the project, a teacher from Ban Khlong Nam Sai school in the Office of the Basic Education Commission, Yala Province, was selected to receive the “Princess Maha Chakri Award” from Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. This award is given to teachers who make changes, and improve students’ quality of life to be successful and contribute to education.

The Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project also sponsors activities to develop careers, self-reliance and income for families; for example raising livestock and chickens and growing mushroom for school lunches. The project also supports the purchase of sewing equipment to further process goods into higher value products. It has helped develop the communities into a learning center based on the Sufficiency Economy concept to learn about new careers and help families to be more self-sufficient and live sustainably.

# Career Development with ThaiBev Project

ThaiBev is supporting projects to promote quality of life and environmental protection in remote communities with diverse ethnicities and languages.

## The Beta Young Entrepreneur Start-up Business and Simulated Business Certificate Presentation Ceremony, April 26, 2019

"The students get to learn from experience, whether it is a simulated business or a start-up business. They are able to adapt and learn from real life experience. They can combine this experience with their studies. When they start working, the important things are the opportunities and the skills that they have; it is not just knowledge. If the students don’t have a chance to practice, there will not be any opportunities for them to improve their skills and knowledge for future use."

Over the past year, the EISA project has expanded its network into different sectors. This gives students the opportunity to train and practice different activities. For example:

- In collaboration with Bangkok University, 50 MICE Management students from the School of Communication Arts interned at the "100 PLUS Grand Criterium 2018" event in Buriram province, and "Mueang Nhoe Bike" in Suphan Buri province. Students had the opportunity to work as a team to organize the competitions. The students were responsible for tasks such as field management, televising competitions, and setting up exhibitions. Students learned directly from professionals on planning, teamwork, and organizing competitions. The students’ performances at the events were used for student evaluations at the end of the semester.

- In cooperation with the Design, Business & Technology Management (DBTM) program at the Faculty of Architecture and Planning at Thammasat University, students participate in a case study provided by Fraser Property (Thailand) Public Co., Ltd and Grand Unity Development Co., Ltd. The students began by analyzing work plans and observing operations to identify problems and pinch points to create effective operational guidelines for the development firms. This project is compulsory for final-year students in the DBTM program. The students benefit from this project by working with leading companies to improve their skills and share useful knowledge with experts in various fields.

# Goals of EISA Project

By 2025, EISA aims to build deeper relationships with existing partner universities, and to forge a stronger connection and more ways to cooperate. Moreover, the project intends to promote and support various educational activities to continue to benefit the students and to create a good image of the ThaiBev Group in the students’ hearts.

## ThaiBev Initiatives

- **Chang U Champion Cup**: ThaiBev is a major supporter for the annual football tournament, a stage for more than 500 university football players to compete, train, and improve their chances of becoming professional footballers while attending university. More than 600,000 students from institutions in greater Bangkok compete in the tournament.

- **Simulated Business**: Students run a convenience store or mini mart as a simulated business (Dummy Business). This is part of the business administration curriculum at various universities.

## Insight

"Everything has been an experience for us to become more professional. Thank you to ThaiBev and the EISA project for giving us the opportunity. The project is like a classroom; it taught us that working at an event gives us the learning experience more than just sitting in the classroom, it is an opportunity to really work."

## Personal Level

The reality TV show "Win Win WAR Thailand" is a business plan competition that identifies and encourages the best social entrepreneurs who apply business mechanisms to solve social and environmental problems. The show is produced to provide knowledge and understanding of the concept "social enterprise" and "business for sharing," and to support start-ups to grow into successful businesses. In 2018, 900 teams applied for the competition, but only 100 were selected to be on the show. Only 20 teams made it to the market test round where they received business advice from experts.

The first winner of the Win Win WAR program in Thailand was the Siam Able Innovation team, "a manufacturer of prosthetics for the disabled, for a life without disabilities" who helps create job opportunities and income for the disabled in the network, and was awarded two million baht along with other support to further develop their business, improve production process, and increase capacity to make prosthetics, and become more widely known. Siam Able Innovation improved disabled people's accessibility to prosthetics at a more affordable price point than imported products from Japan and Europe. At the same time, Siam Able Innovation also created a network for learning about how to produce and fix prosthetics for the disabled and anyone who is interested, truly an inspiration and outstanding example of social enterprise. In 2019, Win Win WAR Thailand received the 33rd Golden Television Award for the best game show program category. Therefore, C asean is moving forward to support program production for the second year, while also planning to expand this project to other countries in ASEAN.

![Image of CPR training](image-placeholder)

## Insight

"Thank you to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited for organizing activities to improve basic lifesaving skills for our students. These are important skills that everyone should practice, especially the youth because at this age, there are frequent drowning accidents due to swimming or flooding in the area. The youth may have the opportunity to try to save lives and increase the victim’s chance of survival. If no one is able to do CPR, there would be zero chance of survival during such events. They should know the basics and be able to help solve immediate problems."

# Community Health Clinic Project

In 2016, Grand Royal Group International Company Limited (GRG), a subsidiary of ThaiBev, opened a community health clinic in Hmawbi, Yangon, Myanmar, near the GRG’s factory. The goal is to improve the quality of life and health of communities in the surrounding areas. GRG sponsored the construction of the clinic as well as provided free medical treatment and care. Before building the clinic, GRG consulted with local communities, and collaborated with local experts to identify various health needs. The company also assessed people’s lifestyles in order to provide the best public health services and benefits to the community.

Since the health clinic was established, GRG has supported more than 100 million Kyats, approximately 20 million baht. It also has covered expenses for doctors, nurses, and medicines amounting to more than 18 million Kyats per year (approximately 360,000 baht). Currently, the clinic can treat more than 920 households, or 3,800 people from three villages in Hmawbi. It has treated more than 2,900 people with mild symptoms (such as flu and insect bites) and has reduced the risk of illness in the community by 70%.

![Image of community health clinic](image-placeholder)

# Insight

“I am really grateful that the GRG fulfilled our true needs. I would like to thank GRG for giving us a hospital where we don’t have to pay expensive medical fees. This is essential for the community. There is no medical facility in our village to treat minor illnesses such as flu, cough, typhoid fever, or more serious illness. In the event of an emergency or major surgery, we can receive pretreatment in order to avoid a critical situation. This clinic is beneficial to the communities in this city very much. I sincerely thank GRG.”

ThaiBev provides a budget that allows for the football training to be conducted by well-known coaches, and sponsors competitions throughout the year to help promising athletes achieve their dreams of becoming professional footballers. At least 250 footballers have gone on from this program to compete at various levels of professional Thai football, making the Chang White Elephant project of the Assumption College Thonburi a famous football academy at the youth level. Through the scholarship training program, Assumption has developed a reputation for consistently producing talented professional footballers.

# Youth Long Boat Commentator

Since its inception in 2014, ThaiBev’s Youth Long Boat Commentator Project has worked to preserve this tradition, and the skill of long boat commentating in Thai society. More than 1,000 young people from across Thailand, between the ages of 8–15, have participated in the project. Youth are given the opportunity to learn about long boat commentating from professional commentators. More than 15 young people so far have gone on to become professional commentators, carrying on this charming feature of traditional long boat competitions.

# Golf

Golf is one of the most popular international sports. It requires concentration, calmness, and expertise. Recognizing golf as a sport that can help develop desirable traits that can also benefit society, ThaiBev sponsors projects for aspiring youth to become professional golfers; through three main projects from beginner level to professional.

- **Chang Thailand Junior Golf Circuit**  
  is a golf competition that operates with professional standards. It is designed to build the foundation for youth to become professional golfers. The competition is divided into three age groups: 8–12 years old, 13–18 years old, and 19–21 years old.

- **Chang Thailand Junior Golf Clinic**  
  is a golf training clinic under the supervision of world-class trainers for more than 10 years. Talented youngsters from the Chang Thailand Junior Golf Circuit between 13–18 years are selected to join. The clinic’s training system is divided into three levels and opens seven times a year.

- **ThaiTalent Golfers**  
  is a project to identify young golfers with outstanding skills, through competitions and the clinic. It strengthens the potential of these young golfers to develop into world-class professionals in the future.

ThaiBev invited Mr. Shane Gillespie, a famous American golf pro who organizes golf training courses around the world, to be the primary trainer. Together with four to five Thai coaches, he helped train Thai youth golfers in the Chang Thailand Junior Golf Circuit for a period of up to three weeks.

It created a lot of joy and pride for him and his family to be awarded this prize.*

## Commitments and Achievements

In addition to creating opportunities for young athletes to become professionals, ThaiBev has been successful in establishing networks and creating positive role models for society.

- **Building Role Models:** In addition to training youth for professional athletes, ThaiBev also creates role models in the sports industry who can inspire the future generation. The training programs promote the qualities of determination, discipline, sportsmanship, and living an exemplary life. More than 20 athletes from ThaiBev training programs have gone on to professional success, such as Pipob On-Mo, former footballer of Chonburi FC and the Thai national team, who is now a professional coach. Pipob received various accolades from the club and professional football circles. “To get where I am today, I had to work hard, and harder than others,” he said.

- **Networking:** With its athletic development programs, ThaiBev has built a strong network with the cooperation of more than 200 agencies, both public and private, and more than 8,000 related personnel. This network makes the projects run efficiently, cultivates friendship, and leads to achievements in various fields within the organization, as well as creating overall benefits for Thai society.

# Insight

“My friends and I worked together with love to build a football club in our hometown of Chonburi. From the beginning until today, it has been over 20 years. Everything, I believe, has to start with action and happiness. The result we get is that we are able to give opportunities to children who have different abilities. I use football to create opportunities for them to have a good future and career. Even if they cannot all reach the superstar level, I hope that they will be good people in society and carry on giving opportunities to society. They have received kindness, a chance from us, just like me and my friends in Chonburi who received generosity from ThaiBev. Building a football field in Ban Bueng District has helped us pursue the dream of what we wanted to do. It was a spark for the development of Chonburi’s football. Without this starting point, there might not be a Chonburi FC today. I consider the beginning to be the most important. ThaiBev gives Chonburi FC a chance to deliver that opportunity to youngsters. And we hope that the footballing community will be pleasant and provide good things to Thai society.”

**Anop Singthong**  
Vice President  
Chonburi Football Club and a Chang Beverage Partner, a football club executive regarded as a role model for human resource development. Anop has overseen the development of nearly 2,000 footballers at various levels, leading the Thai media to call him "The Saint of Football."



“I turned pro at the age of 18. When Chang opened a golfer selection, I was selected to join the ThaiBev ThaiTalent project. I was very happy to be sponsored by Chang. I got a chance to be trained by Shane P. Gillespie from the PGA Tour Academy and received advice on my career path. It helped develop my skills to become a more perfect golfer. Being a professional golfer comes with a lot of pressure. We have to admit that although no matter how well we have played or how hard we trained, if there are people who play better than us, we must accept and be proud that we have tried our best. We must accept the skill of the opponent and go back to practice more. It is important to realize that golf is about competing with yourself. Although there are many competitors, we have to be the ones who guide ourselves to success. Thanks to Chang for supporting me for the past ten years. I am very excited and happy to be able to take the brand to compete in one of the oldest major golf tournaments in the world.”

**Kan Charoenkul**  
Professional golfer on the ThaiTalent project; a professional golfer for ten years, Kan has been successful on the world stage, competing in one of the biggest four major golf tournaments.

# Preserving National Art and Culture

There is tremendous economic value in arts and culture. From folk handicrafts to high art, from the way of life in the countryside to great traditional festivals, all create economic benefits, income, and careers for people on many levels. They have also helped build Thailand’s reputation and national pride as well. Thailand, considered the number-one tourist destination in Asia, welcomes more than 30 million foreign tourists each year, generating more than two trillion baht in revenue annually. According to research, about 30 percent of tourism-related income is derived from products and services connected to Thai arts and culture, such as regional festivals, art exhibitions, or sales of souvenirs, artwork, and crafts.

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited

## Sustainability Report 2019

To encourage society to appreciate the value of arts and culture, ThaiBev is committed to disseminating Thainess to the world, with a three-pronged strategy, namely: promoting a creative economy, strengthening the corporate image, and coordinating cooperation between the public and private sectors. This approach aims to benefit the community, society, and the nation as a whole.

From March 7 to 9, 2019, Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, the Phra Chetuphon Temple’s lay ministry, Committee Member of the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation, and the President and CEO of Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, followed Phra Phrom Bundit (Prayoon Thammachitto), who is a committee member of Maha Thera Association, the abbot of Wat Prayoon Wongsawas Temple, the President of the International Council for the Day of Vesak, and the representative of the Supreme Patriarch, Chao Phra Khun Somdej Prawajirawongsakatuan, to The Vatican’s International Conference on “Religions and the SDGs” in Vatican City.

Leading this conference was Pope Francis, head of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, who planned to visit Thailand in November 2019 to perform mass for more than 50,000 Roman Catholic Christians in the country. ThaiBev plans to support this event. In addition, Thai Beverage Recycle Company Limited (TBR) will participate in the Less Plastic Thailand Project by raising awareness about waste sorting and providing bins to collect waste water bottles at the holy mass. TBR’s employees are contributing to this campaign as these activities are in line with the national goal to reduce plastic waste in Thailand.

# River Festival

In 2014 ThaiBev launched the "River Festival," a contemporary cultural festival and Loi Krathong celebration on the longest bend of the Chao Phraya River, which has been arranged for 6 consecutive years. It has been well supported by government agencies, including the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, Ministry of Culture, the Navy, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Tourism Authority of Thailand, Wat Phra Chetuphon Vimolmangklararam Ratchaworamahawihan, Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan, Wat Kanlayanamit Woramahawihan, Wat Prayurawongsawas Worawihan, Yodpiman Riverwalk, Asiatique, The Riverfront, Lhong 1919, Icon Siam, the Riverside hotel group, Chao Phraya Express Boat, and many other partners. Together, these organizations helped promote cultural art and Thai traditions to the world.

The partnership has continued to support two other successful projects for sustainability: the "Clean Canal" project and the "Young Host Inheriting the Culture". Annual survey results show that the satisfaction of visitors to the event is continuously increasing. In the survey, almost 90 percent of Thai interviewees agreed that the event is a good exhibition of contemporary culture. It carries on the tradition of Loi Krathong, according to 98–100 percent of the respondents. It also makes Thai people see Bangkok in a new light. This event can highlight the Thai way of life and helps to support cultural and social sustainability.

The 2019 River Festival was very successful. For instance, visitors gave 98 percent satisfaction score for enjoyment (increased by 29 percent from 2017); 96% for the event being memorable (increased by 31 percent from 2017); 93 percent for event activities (increased by 36 percent from 2017); and overall event satisfaction reached 97 percent (increased by 29 percent from 2017).

The festival generated 2.66 million baht income for communities in the Bangkok area. The event organizers hope to soon expand the event to neighboring ASEAN countries with similar Loi Krathong culture and traditions.

# Insight

## Promotion of Art and Culture, and its Contribution to the Economy, Society, and National Development

"Although advances in science and technology play a significant role today, people still pay more attention to art and culture because they satisfy emotional and mental needs. For this reason, art and culture have enormous economic value. From folk handicrafts to high-art pieces, from the way of life in the countryside to the great traditional festivals, all have an economic impact. That is to say, they are generating income and creating careers for people on many levels, creating a reputation, prestige, and pride for the country too."

"Many countries support arts and culture, directly and indirectly, to stimulate the tourism industry. There are many socio-economic benefits of arts and culture, such as its use as soft power to strengthen international relations, and to open trade and investment channels. The use of cultural resources can drive the creative economy to create added value for products that can enter the international market."

# Water Festival 2019

ThaiBev hosted the "Water Festival 2019" for the fifth consecutive year, in collaboration with the Department of ASEAN Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As Thailand holds the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2019, the "Water Festival" is another big event supporting the government’s policy to publicize Thailand as an art and culture tourism destination. This event aligns with the ASEAN Cultural Year 2019 theme, which highlights diversity, creativity, and sustainability; so that it will be included as part of the ASEAN Cultural Year of Thailand 2019. A tradition that many ASEAN countries share, the Water Festival promotes sustainable cooperation in the ASEAN region.

Compared to the previous Water Festival, the 2019 event resulted in higher satisfaction ratings from tourists. Bangkok and Phuket areas received above average ratings, while people in Chiang Mai and Udon Thani were moderately satisfied. Nearly half of the participants came with a group of families or friends. As a result, 81 percent of the respondents say that they planned to attend the event again next year (survey conducted at Wat Phra Chetuphon Vimolmangkhararam Ratchaworamahawihan, Wat Prayurawongsawas Warawihan, Wat Kalayanamit Woramahawihan, and Phuket). The event generated around 1.13 million baht of income for communities in Bangkok. For next year’s event, the organizers hope to expand the event to neighboring countries that also have similar traditional Water Festivals.

# Insight

**What are your opinions on C asean Consonant which musicians from each country cooperated to create and develop music in the ASEAN region?**

“C asean Consonant is a group of musicians who speak different languages and come from different ethnicities, cultures, beliefs, lifestyles, genders, and ages. They play a collection of indigenous musical instruments in the Southeast Asian region which once was originated on a common ground. The integration of creative music in the C asean Consonant approach is not just about putting new musicians and musical instruments together and playing strange, surprising, fun songs. It is an important area for learning. It is a lively learning process. It is learning about a peaceful coexistence despite the differences of people. It is learning about the heart of ASEAN music from its roots; how to communicate with different societies and different audiences. Even though it’s just a small band, it is a model world of ASEAN member countries, driven by a new generation that conserves and develops the ancient musical instruments, songs, poems, and rhythms. It is a band that creates a new generation of listeners. For four years now, ASEAN music lovers have enjoyed the colorful music of these diverse flavors.”

# Moving Forward

In its art promotion program, ThaiBev continues to demonstrate its commitment based on a three-pronged strategy: creative economy, corporate image, and collaboration.

## "Creative Economy"

Art projects and activities can be propelled continuously forwards with greater visibility, as follows:

- **Bangkok Art Biennale 2020 (BAB 2020) moving forwards to BAB 2022**, with plans to expand activities outside of Bangkok or to recruit artists to participate in public events, to create added value for the country’s art industry, including support provided for the Sunplu Chorus to establish and operate using the social enterprise approach.

- **Waste Management**: waste materials/product labels are used to create pieces of art by artists in the network.

## "Corporate Image"

ThaiBev aspires to be a leader in promoting, conserving, and disseminating Thai and ASEAN culture and art, for example, C asean Consonant, which absolutely embodies ThaiBev intentions in developing Thai and ASEAN arts and cultures.

## "Collaboration"

Expansion of arts and cultural collaboration with the government, private sector, civic society, and the community enterprise sector continuously, to become more diverse. Activities that benefit communities, society, and the nation were encouraged such as the BAB, C asean Consonant, and the Water & River Festival. The goal is to expand partnerships with surrounding communities so that activities can be organized smoothly, and allow people to see the value of collaboration and how it helps bring many benefits to both communities and individuals.

# Community and Social Development

Climate change and the more frequent occurrence of serious natural disasters has adversely affected the price of agricultural products, incomes, and livelihoods of Thai farmers. Between 2015 and 2017, it was found that the number of poor people in Thailand increased by more than 478,000, mostly in the northeastern and northern regions. ThaiBev has been monitoring this problem and recognizes the importance of community and social development. The Group focuses on educating and training farmers, as well as encouraging communities to help conserve forest resources and prepare for natural disasters. These steps are consistent with Articles 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 15 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

ThaiBev has worked consistently for more than 15 years to strengthen communities with the “A Good Community with Smile” project. The project helps communities to be self-reliant and sustainable. By collaborating with partner organizations to organize activities and projects, this project aims to improve the quality of life in targeted communities, while stimulating local economies and protecting natural resources and the environment. The project also creates learning opportunities for children and various disadvantaged groups.

# ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold Project 20th Anniversary

ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold Project is entering its 20th year. The project started handing out warm blankets to vulnerable communities in 2000. This project has received cooperation from the Ministry of Interior, Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, and provincial governors, who collect data on the number of people affected by cold weather in each province.

Every year, 200,000 green blankets are distributed in areas affected by cold temperatures in the north and northeast. To date, 4 million blankets have been delivered across 45 provinces in Thailand. Each year the donation of blankets shifts, depending on changing weather patterns and data from the Ministry of Interior.

## People who received blankets in 2019

| Category                  | Number of People |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| Elderly citizens          | 88,654 people    |
| Low-income households     | 61,095 people    |
| People exposed to cold weather | 33,098 people    |
| Disabled people           | 13,220 people    |
| Unaccompanied children    | 3,933 people     |

# Thai Beverage Public Company Limited
## Sustainability Report 2019

ThaiBev gives employees and business partners the opportunity to buy additional blankets through the "1 share, 1 warm-up" program. In the past year, ThaiBev employees and business partners purchased 1,000 additional blankets for students affected by cold weather in Uthai Thani Province. In addition to delivering the blankets, ThaiBev is supported by business partners from many sectors to help communities in other areas with scholarships, teaching aids, and sports equipment for schools in need.

# "A Good Community with Smile"

This project has been conducted for eight consecutive years. It creates opportunities for more than 3,500 young people in communities surrounding ThaiBev Group factories. The aim is to develop their knowledge and skills with expert teachers in three areas:

- **Football**: Trainers and speakers from ThaiBev Football Academy teach basic skills to local youth.

- **Music and Singing**: With help from the Sukree Charoensuk Foundation, musicians train selected students from various schools who have shown an interest in performing with bands and orchestras, so they can further develop their skills and earn an income through music in the future. Five students are able to enter the competition at the inter-campus level.

- **Art**: Children are taught how to make handicrafts and other products, such as herbal compress balls, woven bamboo, and painted Ban Chiang jars. Speakers from various communities are invited to inspire students to be creative, work hard, and generate income for themselves. ThaiBev encourages young people to learn from these activities and hopes that they will continue to practice these skills throughout their lifetimes.

## Insight

> "Joining the “A Good Community with Smile” project has allowed the foundation to teach and create opportunities for young people in remote areas where the foundation hitherto has not been able to reach. We are covering more area now, because for eight years we have been going almost everywhere with ThaiBev. We share musical knowledge with the children, to help build their capacity for the future."

# Developing Water, Developing Lives, Developing Quality of Life

In order to help communities manage their water resources, ThaiBev has partnered with the Utokapat Foundation under Royal Patronage, implementing His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s principle, "Think Macro, Do Micro." It means that the whole country’s water management must be viewed as a macro system. There must be various water storage areas—large, medium, and small—that are linked. Because we cannot focus on all of them at the same time, we have to start with micro water management at the community level. Through education and collaboration, communities can own and support the application of science and technology. Communities will be able to manage water resources more efficiently, and fit water management practices to social conditions. They will also be able to find, use, reserve, and efficiently manage water, leading to sustainable development, greater productivity, a better economy and quality of life.

ThaiBev has worked with Nong Ping Kai village in Na Bo Kham Sub District, Mueang District, Kamphaeng Phet Province, to solve a water shortage problem that occurs during the dry season, and flooding during the rainy season. The community’s Tao Tai canal was restored and dredged, and a 3,100-meter-long cement support structure was built to reduce water flow velocity during the flooding season. The community’s existing check dam was also improved to increase water storage and deliver water to agricultural areas with greater efficiency. The community has laid down rules for water usage and allocation. In total, the project affects 9,564 rai of agricultural land, with 588 households in four villages benefiting.

# Insight

**Mun Narata**  
Farmer from Nong Ping Kai Community, Kamphaeng Phet Province

“Before we had a problem during floods: the Tao canal weir would often overflow. This made it difficult for the farmers to make a living. During the dry season, water would have to be released from Suan Mak canal into farmers’ plots, a process that took three-to-four days to complete — until ThaiBev and the Utokapat Foundation came to help improve the canal. Now the water management here is better; there is no flooding anymore during the rainy season, and in the dry season.”

**Sa-ngat Phasuwan**  
Farmer from Nong Ping Kai Community, Kamphaeng Phet Province

“In the past, there was an irrigation pipe placed above, but it collapsed, and the water was not able to flow into agricultural areas. During the flooding season, especially from July to August, the water would overflow into farming areas. But then ThaiBev and the Utokapat Foundation came to improve the canal. Now it is easier for water to run into agricultural areas, and farmers are happy.”

# ThaiBev Engages in Forest Conservation with the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center to Improve Quality of Life

Deterioration of forests has occurred where some communities living on high mountains plant monocrops that need little water. Another challenge these communities face is the continuous use of large amounts of chemicals. ThaiBev has, in collaboration with the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Center, successfully applied the His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s development model in Nan province to restore watershed forests and improve local people’s quality of life. Two villages have been chosen for the project: Srinaipan village and Nam Poon village, with 217 villagers participating. The villagers were given professional training and input support, creating employment and income opportunities for local communities, enabling them to reduce expenses and increase income. The communities were also taken on a study visit to the Huai Hong Khrai Center in Chiang Mai Province. Sustainable practices were adapted to suit conditions in the area. The project provides pigs, chickens, frogs, catfish, and tilapia to farmers to improve their quality of life. Participants are also encouraged to preserve the forest and environment by planting tree seedlings and building weirs to keep the soil hydrated. ThaiBev has closely monitored the progress of farmers and hopes that farmers in both villages, have food to eat or crops to sell to generate income of at least 3,000 baht per month on average.

# Watershed Forest Restoration in a Steep Mountainous Area (The treeless mountain)

This project promotes the policy of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment that requires the private sector to participate in the rehabilitation of watershed forests in deteriorated mountainous areas. The pilot projects are located in 13 provinces: Chiang Mai, Nan, Chiang Rai, Tak, Mae Hong Son, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok, Phayao, Phrae, Uttaradit, Lampang, Lamphun, and Loei. ThaiBev sponsored a project to restore watershed forests in Tak province at Sri Khirirak village, Chiang Thong Sub District, Wang Chao District. This is a small village with a population of 994 people, 189 households, and 157.38 rai of deteriorated forest.

Together with local communities, ThaiBev helps grow and care for tree seedlings, plant various economic crops, gives educational training, and provides support for agriculture, livestock and fisheries. For example, mushroom cultures, chickens for eggs and meat, and tilapia-breeding skills for a student lunch program. The project also aims to reduce household expenses and promote livelihoods for the communities to be self-reliant and sustainable, which in the next few years, green area would be expanded more than 50 rai.

# The Recovery of Nature in the Environment Project, in “Celebration of the Auspicious Occasion of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn’s 5th Cycle Birthday Anniversary”

ThaiBev supports the restoration of forest areas and biodiversity in a 17-rai plot of land at the Sirindhorn International Environmental Park in Phetchaburi province, under the Joining Forces for the Recovery of Nature in the Environment Project, in “Celebration of the Auspicious Occasion of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn’s 5th Cycle Birthday Anniversary.” A budget of 2,978,400 baht was provided, as ThaiBev’s management team and volunteers joined to help with reforestation and mangrove rehabilitation, from 2015–2020.

In 2019, ThaiBev used drip irrigation systems and water spraying trucks to plant and water existing trees in a total area of 17 rai. Cow manure was added to these trees three times a year and the trees were cultivated to help increase their growth. The area is divided into two plots.

# Clean Water for Community Project in Myanmar

An outstanding community development project sponsored by Grand Royal Group International Company Limited, a ThaiBev subsidiary, is taking place in Myanmar. The company foresees that central and southern parts of Myanmar will be facing water shortages. According to a 2014 World Bank report, more than 30 percent of the Myanmar population still do not have access to water. In some regions of Myanmar, the population faces severe water shortage problems. The Grand Royal Group initiated the Clean Water for Community Project in 2016 to help solve the problem, educate the communities about clean water, and allow them access to clean water sources for daily use. Even during a disaster, there are techniques to treat water in order to survive.

From April 2016 to September 2019, the Grand Royal Group donated more than 800 million kyats, or 15 million baht (referring to the exchange rate as of September 30, 2019) to build water reservoirs, water tanks, and water distilleries. The company provided equipment and personnel to maintain operations for ten projects. The Grand Royal Group has initiated five new projects between October 2018 and September 2019, including a project to build a groundwater reservoir in the Mandalay area, and four water treatment systems in the Ayarwaddy area, at a cost of 6.5 million kyats, or 120,000 baht. Since the project began more than four years ago, Grand Royal Group has built eight wells and 16 water tanks. The five clean water treatment projects in ten locations benefit more than 40,000 people who are in need, covering 6,000 households and nine villages in Yangon, Mandalay, and Irrawaddy areas, resulting in reducing the health problem of 840 cases caused by unclean drinking water.



## 2018–2019 Snapshot

- **Each clean water project can deliver up to:**
  - **162,772 liters of water per day** for local communities, a total of **11,583,360 liters per year**

- **More than 9,543 people or 2,080 households,** benefit from community clean water projects

- **Reduced a total of 48 cases of illness** caused by unclean water

Villager from Tha Htay Kone, Meikhtila, Mandalay, Myanmar

"In the past, we had many people die from problems with water. Villagers used rainwater that they collected in the rainy season. But when the rainwater ran out, we faced the same problems all over again. In our area, there is only one pond located at the entrance to the village, and there are problems associated with using the pond water. For daily use, we had to get up at 2 AM to fetch the water. The projects that Grand Royal has done are very good and effective in helping the villagers in this area. Now we have no shortage of water. Thank you very much for the help from Grand Royal, because a sustainable water supply is the most important thing for human life. I thank Grand Royal from my heart. We hope that you will continue to support this project in the future."

This year it was implemented at Wat Phuetmit School in Klong Luang District, Pathum Thani Province on September 12, 2019, benefiting a total of 839 students, and 49 teachers and school employees. The project helps reduce the cost of drinking water by as much as 450 baht per person per month (average expense is 15 baht per day), equivalent to 4,795,200 baht per year. Furthermore, it can help reduce the risk of illness due to drinking unclean water, such as gallstones and gastrointestinal diseases, and thus preventing the occurrence of medical expense in the future. After delivering the water system to the schools, OISHI monitors the water quality every two months to ensure that drinking water production systems remain safe and of good quality.

## Disabled People’s Quality of Life Improvement Project

Sermsuk PLC, in collaboration with the Nakhon Ratchasima and Sisaket Employment Offices, Suranaree University of Technology, Internal Security Division 2, and the Army Region 2, implemented a project to promote and develop the quality of life of the disabled according to the Persons with Disabilities Empowerment Act, B.E. 2550 (2007) and its amendment (Vol. 2) B.E. 2556 (2013). From 2017 until now, Sermsuk has already implemented projects to benefit 167 people with disabilities in the northeastern region, with a budget of approximately 6,295,520 baht/year. The projects implemented are divided into two types, as follows:

1. **Handicapped Career Building Project**  
   Sermsuk, together with Suranaree University of Technology, organizes three career training courses for people with disabilities as appropriate for their physical condition, including raising hens, planting hydroponic crops, and growing mushrooms. The courses provide the disabled with vocational training by skillful experts ranging from technology transfer, teaching management methods, and household accounting to develop skills, knowledge, and abilities with an emphasis on the use of local resources for maximum benefit, as well as...

# Achievements

118 people with disabilities participated in the career building project and increased their incomes by an average of 3,000 baht per person, per month. In the past, these people were unemployed, but now they are able to pursue careers according to the training.

## 2. Disability Employment Project

Sermsuk, together with the Nakhon Ratchasima and Sisaket Employment Offices, considers hiring disabled people with skills, readiness, knowledge and ability in administration, information technology and other office work skills suitable for their physical conditions to work in government departments and in the Internal Security Operations Command Region 2 Army Region 2 in twelve provinces in the northeast region with wages supported by Sermsuk throughout the contract period.

### Achievements

49 people with disabilities participated in the employment program and have been able to use their skills and knowledge in their careers while generating an average income of 9,368.33 baht per person, per month.

The project provides opportunities for the disabled to pursue appropriate careers, so that they can use their full potential at work, develop learning skills and earn an income for themselves and their families. This allows them to achieve a better quality of life and to be treated equally by people in society. On November 8, 2019, the project was selected as one of the two outstanding projects by the Internal Security Operations Command Region 2 Army Division 2. Therefore, ThaiBev had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and present the project’s achievements.

# Commitments and Achievements

The Right Livelihood Foundation presented the “Model for the Right Livelihood” award to Thanthip Sirinuphong, the director of ThaiBev’s Community Development Program. The award recognizes her role as the executive of an organization that promotes community development work and improves communities’ livelihoods. This community development work is based on the concept of developing a “role model.” Role models have been created for better living in three sub-districts: Phon Thong Sub-district in Chaiyaphum Province, Bua Yai Sub-district in Nan Province, and Khao Tan Sub-district in Surat Thani Province. Each sub-district is focused on a different type of economic growth, depending on the resources available to each region. In addition, they foster strong community leadership to develop and manage their own areas sustainably.

### What are the guidelines for cooperation with ThaiBev in joint operations

"The Foundation has introduced His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanathbophit The Great’s principles and initiatives in the rehabilitation and conservation of soil, water and forest resources, and the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. It is an extension of the royal initiatives to enable communities to be self-reliant and manage water on their own. The cooperation with ThaiBev extends the development of water resources; communities are provided with water for agriculture. ThaiBev supports agriculture in accordance with the New Theory concept His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanathbophit The Great. It is hoped that the community will have continuous harvests throughout the year, resulting in food security. ThaiBev promotes economic stability for the wellbeing of people in the community and for their families to live happily together. This helps strengthen the social structure."

### How do you feel about ThaiBev and corporate social responsibility (CSR), water management, and water development, and its impact on the community and society

"Working with ThaiBev has been ongoing since the foundation was established in 2007. ThaiBev has always seen the importance of water management in accordance with the royal initiatives, and has continuously supported it. The Utokapat Foundation does not focus on organizing activities only from time to time—it emphasizes continuous development to ensure the community’s stability with water, food, and the economy. The Foundation hopes that the private sector will continue to work together to help develop water resources in accordance with the royal initiative of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanathbophit The Great, for greater social sustainability."

# Pracharath Rak Samakkee Project

The President and CEO of ThaiBev, Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, has taken on the important mission to be the head of the private sector working group, working together with General Anupong Paochinda, Minister of Interior, as the head of a government working group, to drive local economic and social enterprise development under the San Palang Pracharath public-private partnership initiative. This project operates in conjunction with the government’s important policies to bring together various sectors, including the public sector, private sector, civil society, and academia, to solve problems and find ways to drive the country’s local economy.

# Local Economic and Social Enterprise Development

The Working Group on Local Economic and Social Enterprise Development has introduced His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great’s (Rama IX) Sufficiency Economy and philosophy on the development of "Understanding, Accessing, Developing," in accordance with the royal initiative to truly realize the needs of the local people. This initiative aims to create opportunities for them to generate income, improve their quality of life, and enhance the local economy. The ultimate goal is to drive and develop the country towards stability, prosperity, and sustainability.

The working group also adheres to the first Royal Command of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua (Rama X), "I shall continue, preserve, and build upon the royal legacy and shall reign with righteousness for the benefit of the people forever," as a framework for creating concepts and principles of operation focused on three areas: namely agriculture, value-added products, and community-based tourism. The working group has jointly established a company in the form of a social enterprise under the name Pracharath Rak Samakkee (Social Enterprise) Co., Ltd. in 76 provinces nationwide. It has also established a company called Pracharath Rak Samakkee Project Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. to team up with 20 private companies for them to be a central unit for successful linkage between different sectors.

Through this integration, the company has achieved results and generated revenue for communities comprising more than 60,000 households, with a total revenue of 543 million baht. The project has also led community products (OTOP) sales to grow from 109,000 million baht in 2015 to 125,208 million baht in 2017 to 154,000 million baht and 190,000 million baht in 2018 and 2019 at a rate of 15 percent, 23 percent, and 24 percent respectively. The rate is considered high when compared to the country’s gross domestic product which grows at three-to-four percent per year. This success has driven the government to create the Social Enterprise Promotion Act of 2019.

This collaboration to move forward in the form of social enterprise has allowed the government to see the importance of this type of business as a forum for cooperation that will lead to sustainability in accordance with all 17 United Nations Sustainability Goals (SDGs). Therefore it enacted the Social Enterprise Act 2019, which was announced in the Royal Thai Government Gazette on February 27, 2019. This Act is the first law certifying the status of a juristic person to be a social enterprise in this region. It can be seen that the joint operation of San Palang Pracharath public-private partnership initiative has great potential to change and reform the country. It is considered the main driving force of the Thai economy on the local level to enable communities to run businesses based on sustainable practices.

# Project Outcome

- Generated revenue for communities comprising more than **60,000 households**.
- A total revenue of **543 million baht**.

The project has also led community products (OTOP) sales **to grow**:

| Year | Revenue (million baht) | Growth Rate |
|------|------------------------|-------------|
| 2016 | 109,000                |             |
| 2017 | 125,208                | 15%         |
| 2018 | 154,000                | 23%         |
| 2019 | 190,000                | 24%         |

- The growth rates of 15%, 23%, and 24% are significantly higher than Thailand's GDP growth, which has been 3-4% annually.
- This supports the establishment of the Social Enterprise Promotion Act 2019.

# Thai Handicraft Pakaoma Project

This project commenced its activities on August 12, 2016. The project aims to raise awareness about the diversity and usability of Pakaoma, a local fabric of Thailand with a long history. By developing their quality and improving production techniques, the project also aims to make the processing of hand-made Pakaoma more diverse and meet the needs of consumers. As a result, the value of these traditional products that have been produced in the Thai countryside for a long time is increased and local communities are able to gain a more sustainable income.

In addition, the project is focused on finding Pakaoma that reflect the distinctive identities of various communities around the country, as well as providing opportunities for students and the general public to have a creative platform for expression through a design contest of hand-woven Pakaoma in various categories. In the past year, the project has initiated a cooperation with the Thai Pakaoma community to create innovations for Thai Pakaoma by producing garlands of Pakaoma and bouquets of Pakaoma. The project also sponsored the winners of the Pakaoma design contest “Nava-atatak” (innovative identity) to travel to observe activities at Bunka Fashion College, a world class design and fashion institute, and IFF Magic, a fashion event in Japan.

Furthermore, the project also led to the organization of the Pakaoma Design and Development Contest for the third consecutive year under the concept of “Pakaoma, the Precious Identity of ASEAN METROPOLIS” with 282 individual design submissions. The contest was divided into four categories, namely fashion design, jewelry design, home textile design and fabric design.

Over the past three years, the Thai Handicraft Pakaoma Project has increased the income for 15 Pakaoma-producing communities participating in the project threefold, with a total income of over 51 million baht.

## Insights

“Pakaoma has always been in my life because in our house my grandma is the one who weaves them and my mother is the one who transforms them. She used to use natural colors but later changed to chemical colors instead. Until one day, we all came together and thought that we have to revive our sense of community; we have to use our local wisdom to create a unique identity. We then started to use brown-orange from the soil gathered in our community, green from tree leaves, and gray from the combination of three beautiful natural colors. All of these colors are long-lasting and come from our Ban Sa-ngor community. We then used marketing to help with our products. It was a difficult task. We have to always think about how to make it sustainable and how to provide the community with income and have a better quality of life. Therefore, we must not stop to keep improving.”

“We are pleased and happy that Pracharath Rak Samakkee Amnat Charoen came to help develop our group in many aspects, including in regards to the design of weaving patterns to meet the needs of the market, assistance with the procurement of production equipment and the calculations of costs and wages in production, and also marketing. Therefore, all 42 members in the group now have more income due to the continuous orders our group received.”

# Sapai Sainaew Project (Local cloth for bags and straps)

“Yaam,” a type of colorful shoulder bag, has been with the Thai people for a long time. It is a reflection of their ethnic identity and the way of life of the community. To ensure that the Thai-style shoulder bag will not be forgotten, especially among the new generation, ThaiBev has supported the “Sapai Sainaew Project” since April 2018. The project focuses on improving their design and production so that they meet the needs of consumers and increase revenue for the community. 

The project receives cooperation from partners such as the Textile Industry Development Institute, which helps develop weaving techniques, colors, and patterns, and offers volunteer designers to help create beautiful and interesting products. Furthermore, ThaiBev works with Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. to help promote marketing and sales support at various events, including sales via online channels such as Facebook and Instagram under the account name Sapai Sainaew. In addition to the team’s trips to the area to collect in-depth information and help the community develop their products, they also take the community products to sell at various local events such as Baanlaesuan Fair and OTOP Fair, and also to overseas markets. The products have been well received by customers, and as a result, the villagers’ income has increased.

Currently, the Sapai Sainaew Project has a membership of more than 2,932 people in more than 20 provinces, generating a combined revenue (at all sale events supported by ThaiBev) of almost ten million baht in the last 16 months (April 2018–September 2019). Among the communities that ThaiBev and Pracharath Rak Samakkee support, many groups can now stand on their own and continue to develop their own products. Many of them have increased their income, such as Baan San Kong and Baan Sridonchai in Chiang Rai Province and Mae Chaem in Chiang Mai. In addition to improving the products, another important aspect of the project is that many of the young people in the communities who might otherwise leave their hometowns come back to help their parents to develop the products. Thus this project helps keep families together.

Traditional Yaam maker in Ban Mae Ming, Mae Chaeng District, Chiang Mai Province

Somsri is a Pagayor Karen housewife living in Mae Chaem. She did not have a chance to go to school and cannot speak Thai dearly. Her husband passed away from illness. With debts needing to be paid, Somsri chose to weave Yaam to make a living. She taught herself to be very skillful. Somsri formed a group and gathered female members in the village to join. At present, Pracharath Rak Samakkee has helped her group to sell over 100 bags. In total, there are a total of 20 members in the group.

“At first, farming on the mountain top was a happy life. Then my husband got cancer and died. I had 2 children to raise and a debt of 600,000 baht. I felt very discouraged. I wondered if I could go on any longer. Until one day, I gathered up my strength and decided to continue to fight.”

For former inmates, when they leave the prison, no one would want to hire them. Many of them end up back in prison. It is like a vicious cycle in which nobody’s right or wrong. For us, if they are released with some skills and income, we are confident that many of them will choose not to go back to prison. In the end, when they are imprisoned, they get to work, they get to earn some money, and when they are out, they are ready to start a new life. We only hope for this."

# The Hospital Food Safety Project

This project has been in operation since mid-2017. It is an integrated collaboration between the Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ministry of Commerce and universities, with the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network acting as the community liaison. The aim of the project is to find safe production areas for raw food materials both within the province and nearby provinces, to organize farmer groups, to gather the raw materials, and to provide delivery service/transportation of them to hospitals in the participating provinces. Another important goal is to generate income for farmers and community enterprise groups in the area so that they have a market for their safe and sustainable vegetables and fruits. In the end, people in the country will be healthier and happier as a result of the project.

Today, the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network in 29 provinces can deliver safe agricultural products to 41 hospitals nationwide, and more than 63 million baht in revenue has been generated for communities.

“Since Pracharath Rak Samakkee Krabi came into operation here, farmers and villagers in the community have a better life. They have additional careers and have additional income. In an economic downturn when rubber prices fall low, farmers have changed their lifestyles. They turn to grow organic vegetables so that consumers can get quality vegetables from Krabi province. Illnesses among consumers is reduced. For all of this I must thank Pracharath Rak Samakkee Krabi very much.”

# “Ready-to-Mill” Household Rice Miller Project

Pracharath Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise (Thailand) Co., Ltd. jointly developed a compact rice miller suitable for household rice milling. It is able to produce a sufficient amount of rice for household needs and thus maximize the benefits households receive from the rice they grow. The milling process takes no more than five minutes to complete.

One of the important goals of the development of this household rice milling innovation is to create a new supply chain based on a new marketing channel for farmers, one that allows them to sell native rice varieties directly to consumers at a higher price than through traditional sales. The innovation also helps to encourage farmers to develop their production skills, whether it is through rice drying, selection, packaging or transportation, in order to ensure quality before delivering directly to consumers. The technology also creates more direct income for farmers.

Currently, more than 100 “Ready-to-Mill” household rice millers have been ordered.

# Promoting Community-based Tourism via ["Cheunjai Thailand"] TV Program

ThaiBev supports the budget for producing "Cheunjai Thailand," a creative travel documentary TV program. The goal is to promote community-based tourism and community products nationwide under the operation of the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network. The program has been continuously broadcasting and has featured 144 episodes until now.

Since its first broadcast on July 3, 2016, the program has received positive audience feedback and helped the general public to learn about new tourist attractions operated by communities. The program has also helped bring the communities that have been featured to various fairs and events, enabling them to generate income of over 30 million baht.

## Commitments and Achievements

- Since its implementation, the nationwide network Pracharath Rak Samakkee has driven more than 930 projects, divided into three areas, namely agriculture, value-added products, and community-based tourism, covering more than 68,000 households with more than 545 million baht generated in income. In addition, since January 2019, more than 41 million baht has already been generated for the community.

- Many community products received support for distribution to various public and private organizations, including sales at Pracharath stores and through online media. This has already generated more than nine million baht of income for the communities.

- Network partners are linked together in order to provide space for communities to sell the products of the Pracharath Rak Samakkee network. This year, these events have generated more than 500,000 baht in revenue for the communities, totaling 15 million baht since the project started operating.

# Insight

"Together with ThaiBev, the Department of Community Development has supported and promoted the local economy at the community level under the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy. The project brings together community funds to develop Local Economy on three levels, including:

1. **Promote career creation and income at the household level**  
   This is in accordance with the goal of enhancing the honest livelihood approach that encourages people not to be exploited by others, reduce dependency on outside resources, avoid spending extravagantly, and stop all vices.

2. **Promote collaboration**  
   A group is organized to collectively buy and sell products. This will help community entrepreneurs to initiate production and trading.

3. **Create cooperation and network (interdependent):**  
   This is an expansion of the economic production system and is part of the economic system at the community and local level. It is considered a form of social enterprise.

Although the implementation of the Pracharath Rak Samakkee Project is something new in Thai society, through hard work over the past four years, we have been able to promote local economy and social enterprise in order to create stronger local market."

# Consumer Health, Safety and Wellbeing

The health issues of the world population are a major problem today. According to a World Health Organization report, 73 percent of deaths worldwide in 2020 is predicted to be from chronic non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. At the same time, the change in communication technology is another factor that is making consumers aware of the importance of health and wellbeing. Consumers can search for nutritional value and product safety information from various sources. As the largest producer and distributor of beverages and food in the country, ThaiBev places great importance on health and consumer safety to meet future market growth, starting from procurement of quality and safe raw materials. ThaiBev conducts research to develop more healthy products by reducing the amount of sugar, sodium and fat as well as controls the production process to meet international standards of consumer health products while still preserving the original flavor. In addition, to give consumers confidence in the safety of raw materials, ThaiBev discloses the nutritional value of products such as energy, sugar, fat and sodium by using food labels as a communication tool.

# OISHI Gold

OISHI developed a new tea formula, "OISHI Gold," with tea leaves from Matsuda Tea Plantation, a quality tea plantation in Japan. The plantation is located on the Makinohara Plateau, Japan’s number-one tea growing area that is extremely fertile with year-round sunlight and temperatures that are best suited for tea growing. Most importantly, it is a cultivation area that receives spring water that flows directly from the Japan Alps, which is considered as a clean and pure water source. This makes the best quality tea as confirmed by many quality awards, such as The Emperor’s Cup trophy from the Emperor of Japan.

The Matsuda Tea Plantation implements meticulous growing methods by hand-picking all tea leaves, selecting only the three youngest leaves from the buds. The tea leaves are steamed to preserve tea quality before being pressed. This method creates a chemical process that brings out a special aroma in the tea leaves. This process must be done within four hours to keep the tea as fresh as possible. OISHI has developed these high quality tea leaves into a premium healthy drink. With its outstanding feature of mellow taste and low sugar content, OISHI Gold has been certified as “Healthier Choice Logo” by the Nutrition Foundation, Mahidol University.

## 1. OISHI Gold Genmaicha

Genmaicha is the first premium Japanese roasted rice tea to be available in Thailand. The three youngest tea leaves are hand-picked and combined with top quality Japanese roasted rice; an original recipe from 1930 giving the tea a mellow, fragrant, and unique flavor. The soft tea flavor makes it easy to drink. The flavor is elevated when taking with food making Genmaicha popular among the Japanese. OISHI Gold Genmaicha comes in two formulas; no sugar and minimal sweet (Delight).

## 2. OISHI Gold Kabusecha

Kabusecha tea is a premium green tea that is produced through a different cultivation process than other green teas, where a black mesh is used to cover the green tea leaves to prevent them from being exposed to direct sunlight for a week prior to harvesting. Since the tea leaves are not exposed to direct sunlight, they develop a more delicate aroma and flavor than other green teas. The leaves also contain theanine, a natural compound that helps reduce astringent taste for perfect concentrated flavors. OISHI Gold Kabusecha comes in both sugar-free and minimal sweet (Delight) formulas.

# Reducing Sugar in Products

To promote consumer health, ThaiBev has been focusing on reducing sugar content in non-alcoholic beverages without affecting the original taste of the products for the past two years. Currently, ThaiBev is able to reduce the amount of sugar in all 14 products (compared to 2014 as a base year), by more than 9,800 tons in 2019.

## Project Performance

| Reduced sugar content in | Sugar used in the production process was reduced by more than |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **14 Products**          | **9,800 tons** in 2019                                        |
| compared to 2014 as a base year |                                                       |

## Insight

“In a nationwide survey, close to 80 percent of ThaiBev’s consumers are opting for healthier choices of food and beverages in their daily diet. More than 55 percent of drinkers seek low calories and low sugar alternatives. With this healthier trend, ThaiBev is making efforts in developing healthier products, and we place importance on developing and reformulating lower sugar products. Our est Cola and est PLAY brands, where the majority of our consumers are teens and young adults – are continually being reformulated to drive down sugar content as well as launching new products that come certified with the “Healthier Choice” label. In our product portfolio, our premium ready-to-drink tea OISHI Gold serves up one of the healthiest options since it is produced from premium tea leaves right from the source where it is grown. The ready-to-drink teas are available in two options: low and no sugar.

In addition, safety is our highest priority for the millions of bottles that we serve. We are proud of our strict guidelines to ensure the highest quality and safety throughout our entire supply chain from sourcing to storage, transportation, production, and distribution. This is guaranteed by our ISO22000, NSF, BRC, and GMP/HACCP certifications. The company believes that our consumer palettes are ready to evolve into healthier choices, and it is our job to serve healthy lifestyles in a tasty and enjoyable way.”

# Promoting Good Consumer Health

ThaiBev has adjusted all ramen noodles recipes to be free of preservatives and monosodium glutamate in all OISHI affiliated restaurants, such as OISHI Ramen and OISHI Eaterium. This includes the "OISHI Eato" ramen ready-to-eat food product group, such as stir-fried clam ramen with chili paste, yakisoba with pork and vegetables, and teriyaki chicken ramen with nabe sauce.

# Food Menu from KKUI Chicken

The KKUI or Isan Pearl 2 chicken breed, is a research development by the Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University. In collaboration with Pracharath Rak Samakkee Khon Kaen Company (Social Enterprise), farmers are encouraged to raise this breed of chicken to generate additional income. The outstanding properties of this breed are low uric acid levels (only 1.91 mg percent which is lower than other types of commercial chicken breed), less fat, with thick, firm, and tasty meat, and low in cholesterol. Most importantly, there are no hormones or antibiotics. This breed of chicken grows quickly, is easy to raise, and can be raised free-range. Currently, the food business group uses the meat of this chicken breed in dishes such as Volcanic Grilled Chicken and Turmeric Grilled Chicken at Café Chilli Bangkok Ruumruedee, and Whole Roasted Chicken and Braised Chicken at Hyde & Seek @Plaza Athenee.

# Customer Relationship Management

Customer Management is the key to build long-lasting relationships with customers. ThaiBev categorizes customers into two segments: customers and consumers. Customers are those that sell and distribute ThaiBev’s products. Consumers are those that ThaiBev directly sell and distribute products to. ThaiBev develops strategies for each segment as they are ThaiBev’s key stakeholder groups.

## Customers

Business-to-Business (B2B) model is used to manage relationships with the customer segment. ThaiBev has implemented various programs to help develop customer relations across all distribution channels as well as providing trusted advice as a business consultant to help customers adjust their work process, increase competitiveness, efficiency and sales, and improve working relationships with ThaiBev. This will ensure sustainable profits and customer’s satisfaction with a lasting and stable business relationship.

## Consumers

Business-to-Consumer (B2C) model is used to manage relationships with the consumer segment. ThaiBev has applied technology to improve operations with online applications to meet the changing lifestyles and the growing needs for convenience, speed, and accuracy. An implementation of new consumer-friendly technology keeps ThaiBev’s food business as a top-of-mind brand.

# Triple A Project

This project was introduced in 2018, an extension of the Agent’s Next Generation Development (Agent Next Gen). The goal in 2019 is to develop capacity and efficiency of agents in each area, including organizational management, warehouse management, logistics, and Cash Van Management by setting standard operating procedures and systems to increase efficiency and drive towards results. The Triple A team pilot project with Siriwongsub Co., Ltd., a ThaiBev distributor in Ratchaburi, has resulted in higher satisfaction and an increase of sales. ThaiBev has therefore expanded this project to another 10 agents to achieve a goal set for 2019.

## Insight

### Agent: Siriwongsub Co., Ltd.

**Aurtasa Khemathon**

“After working with the ThaiBev sales support team to improve our work processes, we have now clearly assigned the responsibilities of each employee and ensure that they can work interchangeably in every position. We collect and check data on any errors for correction and improvement. We have a more accurate accounting system applied for monitoring errors that can reduce losses.

The Cash Van Development team has set up 3 systems, including Dashboard, Morning Talk, and On-the-Job Training (OJT). The Dashboard is a very important tool that has made our team more enthusiastic and competitive, as well as improve data collection. As for the Morning Talk system, it has enabled the team to communicate more effectively. They can use information from Dashboard to solve problems and improve their work. Our team can discuss challenges daily together, and collectively decide what parts they can fix and improve. OJT offers sales staff intensive one-on-one training activities. Information gleaned from the Dashboard and Morning Talk are used to discuss how the team can improve and increase sales. Activities to improve our team leaders’ capabilities also have been arranged. This enables them to better solve problems and design clearer work plans with specific roles and responsibilities, which they pass on and teach our sales staff.”

**Jeerawan Khemathon**

“The Morning Talk activity helps our employees become more open and communicative. Every morning, they have an open conversation and let each other know what’s happened the day before. This allows employees to solve real-time problems, be well prepared to help each other to generate sales. It makes everyone feel fresh every morning; they sit down and chat before going out to sell products with a positive attitude.”

**Wichin Khemathon**

“Help from Thai Beverage Logistics Co., Ltd. (TBL) by warehouse management has allowed us to save time in transporting products; and products are now arranged in a cleaner and more orderly manner. We can count product quantities and check on them more easily. The efficiency of our transportation system has been improved as well. By conducting vehicles to pick up products directly from the TBL warehouse, Siriwongsub has enjoyed an increase in revenues. Previously, we would deliver products and return empty vans to our warehouse; but now vans will drop by at TBL to pick up products first and come back to the warehouse fully loaded. This way, revenue has been increased, employees get more work done, and time and vehicle utilization has become more efficient.”

# Training School Project

The Training School teaches ThaiBev’s agents to systematically improve their skills and experience in sales, resulting in an increase in sales potential. It also serves as a knowledge center for new employees of ThaiBev Cash Van distribution channel, a subsidiary of ThaiBev (Cash Van Management Co., Ltd.) There are 8 operational training schools located in all 8 ThaiBev Sales Regions, featuring lecturers with more than ten years of sales experience. They can annually provide 100% training required for ThaiBev’s new sales staff (workforce has been increasing year-by-year), and for 350-400 agents’ sales staff. The training course covers theory and practice, including actual operations at model shops simulated by retailers, that are set up at training schools in each sales region.

The sales staff, who have passed the training course, have a better understanding of their roles and perform more efficiently. This project also monitors and evaluates trained employees, resulting in sales and product distribution increase by at least 30%.

In 2020, ThaiBev plans to add 8 additional training schools in each sales region (totaling 16 schools), to cover areas that are suitable with the training program and to accommodate more participants. ThaiBev expects to be able to train new sales staff and agents’ sales staff at the rate of 800–1,000 persons annually. By 2025, ThaiBev plans to set up a comprehensive training school for executive sales development and to raise sales capability to international standards.

## Insight

### Agent: J.Sermsup Co., Ltd.

“In the past, our company used to sell products in a traditional way. We did not have a concrete plan; we would focus on generating sales from the company’s regular clients (stores). Our company lacked good sales techniques. However, after ThaiBev came in to advise and support us with staff training, our employees learned better practice and became more enthusiastic. They know how to plan and organize visits to retail stores. Our employees can increase sales and try to achieve their goals. After participating in the training, the employees feel that they have gained knowledge, met new friends and shared work experiences. Our company believes what ThaiBev recommends or teaches is great, and standardized. It is beneficial and can be used to develop the organization. We have always felt like part of the same family, and we would like to thank ThaiBev for recognizing the importance of sustainable organizational development.”



“I started working for Cash Van as a salesman at Khonburi Unit, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, in June 2018. I did not have any knowledge about the sales process. When I started, I had learned from my supervisor as well as participating in the on-the-job training program and learning how to sell products according to the plan. We typically would sell products to stores that regularly buy from us, but after participation in sales process with training practice at ThaiBev school, I have more confidence that I can improve my performance. The training school monitors and evaluates trainees to ensure that their performance is more consistent with ThaiBev standards. For example, a daily sales plan helps me to work more systematically. I can increase daily sales by an average of 5-10%. So I am proud to be a part of ThaiBev because it has been helpful to educate and develop my career potential. I feel I am an important part of helping ThaiBev to grow sustainably as well.”

# Restructuring Customer Service in Modern Retail Trade

In order to meet high customer satisfaction levels, ThaiBev has implemented a restructured operational system for modern retail customers, such as 7-Eleven, Tesco Lotus, and Modern Trade Management Co., Ltd. (MTM) (a subsidiary of ThaiBev), to achieve the following:

- **Increase the speed and flexibility of handling, contacting, and serving customers** engaged in modern retail trade. In the past, ThaiBev had separately managed its product groups, with many different sales representatives meeting with each customer. Now, ThaiBev has restructured its sales management team so that only one contact person coordinates and communicates with each key account.

- **Organize an annual joint business plan and business review:** This practice provides a space for ThaiBev and its customers to share, and to exchange information in order to reduce obstacles. It also helps increase opportunities for ThaiBev to offer additional products and services to customers and consumers through the customers’ retail stores so that business relationships are expanded and developed for the future.

## Insight

> “As joint strategic partners, it is necessary for ThaiBev and 7-Eleven to plan things together. ThaiBev is able to provide key information about changing market trends, and 7-Eleven knows the needs of their customers. So, both parties can combine this expertise to serve the needs of their customers and consumers: it is a win-win strategy for both companies. With consumer satisfaction as our focus, joint business plans can be consistently implemented throughout the year, enabling both businesses to grow sustainably together.”

# Key Commitments and Achievements

To meet expectations of modern consumers who demand convenience and speed, ThaiBev has introduced new technology to customers and storefront staff. This allows customers to access information and services quickly and conveniently, via the BevFood mobile application (a replacement for the OISHI Pointo application). In the initial phase, BevFood will provide access to a customer loyalty program to accumulate points when visiting OISHI brand restaurants. Customers can choose to redeem points for discounts under specified conditions. ThaiBev has developed gift vouchers as mobile coupons and sends marketing messages and personalized promotional text messages to drive sales. Limited special offers help to drive short-term revenue.

Introduced in 2019, BevFood will add more features and benefits, such as discounts or promotions in local areas, payment via QR Code (an important turning point for the rapid growth of a cashless society), advance reservations, and the ability to order food and make payments through the application.

# Serve Responsibly

The Serve Responsibly program was created to raise awareness of alcohol servers at hotels and restaurants that are ThaiBev’s customers. ThaiBev holds workshops with invited experts and professionals such as doctors, police, and lawyers to educate servers about legal and medical issues that can arise due to alcohol consumption. Lecturers explain the effects of alcohol on the body that result from drinking alcohol, and provide guidelines on how to serve alcoholic beverages responsibly. Servers are trained in consumer safety and are taught to refrain from serving alcoholic beverages to customers who drink irresponsibly. The program aims to reduce problems that may occur in society due to overconsumption of alcohol. Three workshops take place each year.

2019 marked the fourth year of the program. ThaiBev has expanded the workshops to hotels and premium restaurants as well as pubs and bars located in popular tourist destinations such as Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiang Mai, and Phuket. More than 150 alcohol-serving staff have participated. ThaiBev has improved the workshop from the previous years by asking participants to take part in activities and share their opinions. Participants were divided into five teams to compete in activities that encourage them to think and learn in real-time situations. Teams were quizzed about alcohol laws, taught how to pour standard-sized drinks, and encouraged to share stories about accidents caused by excessive drinking. The Thai Foundation for Responsible Drinking provided information brochures titled “Drink Safely, Serve Responsibly” to participants and media who attended the workshops.

![Image of workshop participants](#)

# Caring for People

In the beginning of 2019, ThaiBev organized a video contest titled "Serve Responsibly". More than 20 groups of students from leading universities submitted their entries through the EISA (Education Institute Support Activity) program. The winning video is shown to participants at the training sessions to help raise awareness about serving alcoholic beverages responsibly. The competition encourages students to think about how to produce creative videos about serving responsibly that benefits society.

Since 2016, ThaiBev has organized eight training sessions with more than 450 entrepreneurs and 100 to 150 alcohol servers participating. On average, each participant serves alcohol to 6,000 customers per year. Thus, more than two million customers are served alcohol by servers that were trained by this program. This promotes safe alcohol consumption. At the end of the training sessions, all participants receive certificates to show that they have completed the training program to serve alcohol in a socially responsible manner. Due to improvements in the training that made it more enjoyable, participants rated their satisfaction in the latest workshop as high as 95 percent.

# Serve Responsibly Program

- **8 workshops organized**
- **Over 450 restaurants and sales/alcohol service providers participated**  
  (100-150 persons per year)

- **1 employee serves 6,000 customers/year** (on average)
- **2 million customers/consumers received good care from employees, resulting in safe consumption of alcohol**

- **Participants are satisfied with the workshop activities: 95%**
- **Satisfied with the courses and content: 95%**

This project is consistent with the third UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3.5 Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol). It was found that alcohol serving staff who completed the training sessions were able to apply the knowledge at work and able to stop serving customers who were not in a condition to consume more alcohol. As a result, the volume of servings decreased 33 percent.

## Commitments and Achievements

In 2019, ThaiBev created a “Serve Responsibly” page on Facebook as a media channel for the project. The page increases awareness via social media so that entrepreneurs, former participants of the project, and the general public can learn about responsible serving and drinking as well as exchange opinions on the issues. Currently, there are more than 800 people following the page and more than 300 personal posts on the Facebook page. These numbers also help enhance the public image of ThaiBev as a socially responsible organization.

“We hope participants will share their knowledge and experience with their co-workers because we believe it’s important for service providers to look after the welfare and safety of consumers. This project has successfully shown consumers that ThaiBev is a socially responsible organization. It is our belief that once every employee sees our good work, they will feel proud to work in such a caring and socially responsible organization.”

**Kamonlani Chaixianien**  
Senior Vice President and Chief Corporate Affairs



“Many people say that the law is difficult to understand and not relevant to them. But this training helps service staff to understand that they are an integral part of looking after the lives of customers and must be socially responsible. As a lecturer, I am impressed by participants’ willingness to learn. For the business to grow sustainably, alcoholic beverages must be sold with morality and consciousness. In addition to taking care of themselves, service staff must take care of our partners and all stakeholders. If they are able to balance these things, it enables entrepreneurs to operate happily and sustainably.”

“I have been working in the hotel industry for about 20 years, but there are still things that I do not know or am mistaken about. Today I came here to learn about legal matters, obtain medical information, and listen to a law enforcement officer’s perspective. This is the kind of information that people working in the service industry should be aware of. Thank you to ThaiBev for organizing beneficial activities for entrepreneurs in Khao Yai. I am confident that the participants in this training will be able to truly serve responsibly.”

# Employee Engagement through ThaiBev Global Values and Performance Management Culture

**Strategy 2**  
**Strategy 3**  
**Strategy 7**

ThaiBev's focus is to create a culture that emphasizes excellence through performance management. During the past year, 100 percent of employees were evaluated as well as put through calibration, comparison, and ranking of the evaluation scores of employees in the same group. This evaluation process is connected to the competitive compensation and welfare framework of ThaiBev. In particular, the link between performance and bonuses has been strengthened, increasing the compensation ratio related to performance excellence over the past year. This increases the average rate of bonuses for those with excellent results up to three times the average of those with good contributions, an increase from the previous average of 1.5 times in the base year.

1. ThaiBev cultivates employee engagement within the organization through the "Say–Stay–Strive" model, which aims to continually improve employee engagement. In addition to helping reduce the rate of resignations, the model also encourages employees to continuously create value for ThaiBev.

## Employee Initiatives

- **More freedom for employees with flexible work rules**  
  ThaiBev recognizes the importance of family to its employees. In 2019, ThaiBev gave employees the freedom to choose their daily work schedule by announcing flexible working hours for employees of ThaiBev and its subsidiaries working at ThaiBev Quarter facility. This project officially launched on June 15, 2019, with 250 employees participating initially. ThaiBev encourages its employees to have a healthy work-life balance. Employees can choose to avoid traffic congestion during rush hours in the morning and evening to reduce stress. In addition, ThaiBev provides co-working spaces for employees to communicate and meet with their teams. It also provides non-fixed desks or 'hot seats' so that employees can choose their seats to work more conveniently; they can change their seats each day as needed.

- **Reduce cases of office syndrome**  
  Physical and mental comfort can result in positive thinking and increased work efficiency. ThaiBev hires professional massage therapists to treat employees at the corporate office and various factories to reduce tension and fatigue in the neck, shoulders, and upper arms. Massage services are provided every Monday and Thursday, throughout the year. In 2019, more than 1,000 employees used the service.

- **Provide employment opportunities for people with disabilities**  
  ThaiBev offers employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In 2019, 36 subsidiaries under the ThaiBev Group recruited a total of 496 people with four types of disabilities (disabilities of movement, vision, hearing, and intellect) as a way to help the disabled to be self-reliant with dignity the same as others.

  ThaiBev believes in the potential of the elderly. The company is committed to providing opportunities for senior employees who want to continue working after retirement under employment terms and conditions set by the company. ThaiBev provides flexible and suitable working hours for elderly employees. They can choose their working days according to the schedule specified each week as needed. Currently, there are 245 senior employees over 60 years old with in-depth experience, who chose to continue working for the company. Providing such opportunities helps the elderly to be proud of themselves and helps alleviate their financial burdens, allowing them to continue to support themselves and their families.

  In addition, ThaiBev has organized a program to prepare employees for retirement. This program enhances their knowledge in various fields for their benefit and wellbeing in the future. This year, ThaiBev held a lecture on benefits and privileges that employees are eligible to receive from the company and the government — both prior to, and after retirement. Other lectures were given on physical and mental health, money management, and various career channels and hobbies for senior employees to consider in order to better manage their lives after retirement. These lectures have been broadcast live to employees in 23 factories and other agencies, with more than 500 viewers.

  ThaiBev has organized a Monday flea market to give retired employees the opportunity to earn extra income by selling food and other products. The market gives retired employees additional career opportunities, hobbies, and extra income every Monday throughout the year.

- **Respect Human Rights** by treating all parts of the business equally without discriminating between employees, communities, business partners, including children and women, disabled and disadvantaged people, indigenous groups, local communities, and foreign workers.

- **Proactively tackling Human Rights issues** through the Human Rights due diligence process, examining violations of Human Rights through the company’s mechanism on the promotion and protection of Human Rights, and regularly inspecting and monitoring potential Human Rights impacts.

- **Communicate Human Rights practices** to all stakeholders, and providing a transparent and effective channel for complaints, establishing a fair treatment process for those who are affected. In addition, ThaiBev has appointed a labor relations team to advise employees when violations occur in the company.

- **Provide knowledge, training and support** for employees, suppliers, and customers to strictly respect the Human Rights of all stakeholders in their businesses by taking into consideration ThaiBev’s policies and regulations, such as ThaiBev’s Code of Business Conduct, Supplier Code of Practice, and Human Rights Policy. In 2019, a Human Rights workshop was organized for selected employees from various departments at risk of potentially causing Human Rights violations, such as Production, Logistic, Procurement, Sales and Marketing, and Human Capital, to educate them about Human Rights risks.

In 2019, there were no Human Rights violations reported in ThaiBev. However, ThaiBev is aware that its business activities may be directly or indirectly linked to a violation of the Human Rights of stakeholders. ThaiBev is therefore seriously committed to reducing the risk and potential violations by consistently using ThaiBev’s Human Rights risk assessment mechanisms. In addition, the company has implemented additional mitigation measures to solve and reduce the likelihood of Human Rights violations that may result from ThaiBev’s business activities.

# Projects and Initiatives in Support of the Human Rights Policy

## 1. Establishing a Human Rights Due Diligence Process

This program has been organized for the third year since its inception in 2017. In 2019, ThaiBev has identified three important Human Rights risks, which are:

- Employee health and safety
- Employee working conditions
- Community health and safety

The next process is to hold a meeting among all relevant parties to find root causes for collaborative solutions, track success, and further communicate to those involved.

### ThaiBev’s Human Rights Due Diligence Process

1. Policy commitment
2. Assess actual and potential impacts
3. Integrate findings and potential impacts
4. Track and communicate performance
5. Remediate adverse impacts

## 2. Establishing Employee Wellness Management Working Team

Every ThaiBev employee is an important stakeholder of the company and their Human Rights must be honored. Therefore, all employees will be taken care of by the Wellness Management Working Team and the Welfare Committee. This allows employees to fully demonstrate their potential under a suitable working environment. In addition, paying attention to the health of employees, both physical and mental, helps make ThaiBev employees work happily. The Employee Wellness Management Working Team is also an important channel for receiving complaints and learning about grievances from employees whose human rights have been violated.

# 3. Selection and Inspection of Manufacturers and Service Providers for Human Rights Risks

ThaiBev has established the Supplier Code of Practice covering Human Rights issues, applicable to all suppliers. This includes a process to identify Human Rights risks, from selecting new suppliers to annual assessments for active suppliers.

To facilitate communication with suppliers, ThaiBev has an online portal for buying and selling products, the Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM) system (http://www.paninter.com/home). This system mandates new suppliers to comply with the Supplier Code of Practice and undertake risk assessments, including Human Rights, before registration. ThaiBev also has a Procurement Service Center for complaints and problem-solving related to procurement, including Human Rights. These mechanisms ensure suppliers meet the company’s human rights requirements and policies.

## Insights

> “Participating in the Human Rights workshop has helped me understand clearly that Human Rights are an important issue in the context of procurement. This is particularly relevant to the contractor’s employment that I am responsible for, which is a group at risk of Human Rights violation in terms of compensation, and occupational health and safety. In mitigating these risks, ThaiBev has considered Human Rights risks starting from the selection of contractors and stipulated conditions in the contract of employment. In addition, the company has a process for regularly inspecting business partners to ensure that these business partners are aware and comply with ThaiBev’s Human Rights requirements and treat their employees fairly.”

## Moving Forward

- ThaiBev plans to enhance knowledge and understanding of Human Rights through ongoing training and workshops for employees, both domestic and overseas, as well as contractors and suppliers. Annual training includes Human Rights topics in the employee orientation program.

- ThaiBev aims to improve three risk issues identified in the 2019 Human Rights inspection: employee health and safety, working conditions, and community health and safety. ThaiBev is committed to preventing future risks by implementing measures for safety, occupational health, and employee wellbeing across all regions. This includes organizing safety activities and developing paramedic and rescue experts at operation sites and communities around factories.

- ThaiBev conducts on-site risk assessments, including Human Rights issues, for all critical tier 1 suppliers. The company collaborates with key suppliers to mitigate Human Rights risks from non-tier 1 suppliers.

# Corporate Governance and Compliance

Good Corporate Governance is an international corporate management method and an important factor in the organization’s efficiency improvement. It shows that the organization’s management system is efficient and transparent and its operation is aligned with the principles of corporate governance. This creates confidence and trust among shareholders and stakeholders, strengthens ThaiBev’s competitiveness at an international level, and boosts the performance while taking long-term impacts into account. It also ensures that the Company conducts its business in an ethical way, and respects the rights of and is responsible for shareholders and stakeholders, as expected by the business sector, investors, capital market, and society.

# Good Corporate Governance

ThaiBev emphasizes principles of good corporate governance in line with its Code of Business Conduct. Appropriate risk management plans are established in accordance with the Company’s sustainable development approach and information is adequately disclosed to give confidence to shareholders, investors, employees, customers, and stakeholders. ThaiBev also determines to support and develop customers’ business potential for stronger and more sustainable growth in order to add value for shareholders in the long term while considering all stakeholders inside and outside the organization.

The Board of Directors takes the leadership role in the organization and ensures its leading position in the business by determining the directions, strategies, operational objectives, and long-term success for the companies in ThaiBev Group. This allows ThaiBev’s business to be conducted according to its core business plans and the shareholders’ resolutions in an honest manner under the law and the Company’s objectives and articles of association. The Board of Directors also oversees that the companies in ThaiBev Group and their subsidiaries comply with the rules and regulations of the Singapore Exchange and other relevant stock exchanges. (The Company’s organizational structure and Corporate Governance Report are in the Annual Report 2019 and on the website www.thaibev.com)

Furthermore, ThaiBev has announced the use of Whistleblowing Policy as a way to emphasize the importance of receiving and responding to the concerns about suspected wrongdoings within the company, which are raised by directors, executives, and employees. In 2019, there were no significant incidents of conflict found and no significant cases of grievances related to ethics were investigated and found to be valid.

# Code of Business Conduct

Business ethics are a key part of enabling business growth, stability, sustainability, and social acceptance. ThaiBev has established its Code of Business Conduct with the intention of integrity, legal compliance, and the observance of morality and ethics. The executives, managers, and employees all have the responsibility to adhere to the Code of Business Conduct, so that ThaiBev achieves its objective of upholding ethical conduct and maintaining ethical standards.

ThaiBev has a duty to maintain transparency in its operations and protect the interests of its shareholders by considering market conditions and risk factors, both present and future. The company must act correctly towards employees, customers and all its trading partners. ThaiBev is committed that its employees truly understand the content and meaning of the Code of Business Conduct; at every level, ThaiBev personnel are bound to accept and follow the code. If every person connected with the company accepts and practices the Code of Business Conduct under the policy of good governance, the results shall be as follows:

- The company will be able to uphold its responsibility toward society and all stakeholders
- Employees will work efficiently
- There will be fairness
- Employees will have dignity and integrity
- The company will be more socially accepted
- Employees’ happiness and wellbeing

# Anti-Corruption

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of transparency and morality, and adheres to the principles of fairness and compliance with the Code of Business Conduct, while striving to provide maximum benefits for all stakeholders in its business operations, in Thailand and abroad. ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy has established practices to protect against corruption, and to serve as a guideline for promoting business sustainability and stability in the future.

In the case of changes to the business, regulations, standards, and the law, the President and CEO is responsible to monitor and implement an efficient anti-corruption system, report to the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and review and revise policies to ensure they are up-to-date and responsive to any changes. The company has specified the roles and duties of all parties as follows:

- High-level executives are responsible for making sure that board members, supervisors and employees understand policy compliance, encouraging them to be vigilant and proactive.
- Board members and employees have the duty to maintain the highest standards when doing business.
- Employees must not turn away from, or neglect evidence of corruption.
- Employees must cooperate with investigations into the facts.

Failure to act in accordance with this policy is a severe disciplinary offense; it is a violation of the ThaiBev employment contract and a criminal offense. Furthermore, violating this policy may cause severe damage to the company’s reputation and status. If corruption is discovered, it should be reported to the employee’s line manager. If a person is discovered to commit an offense, they will be punished according to ThaiBev’s regulations and prosecuted under the law.

# Handling Complaints

ThaiBev has a policy that all employees are obligated to file a complaint if they discover an act that may be considered wrongdoing.

- If a board member has a complaint, the board member should file the complaint to the Chairman of the Board to investigate.
- If an employee has a complaint, the employee should file the complaint in writing through the recommended channels, giving their name and contact details and file it with a responsible company official.
- Every employee may report suspicious information directly to the President and CEO through the email whistleblowing@thaibev.com, or send it directly to executives.
- ThaiBev is ready to protect any employee who files a complaint with a factual basis; confidentiality will be maintained while taking strict action against wrongdoing.
- An employee filing a complaint will be free of repercussions or damage if the complaint is filed in good faith.
- Appropriate action will be taken to protect executives and employees from any harm that may arise from filing the complaint.

When an employee files a complaint, ThaiBev will decide how to proceed. If it is found afterwards that the complaint was false, corrupt, malicious, careless, or for personal benefit, this will be considered a disciplinary offense as stated in the ThaiBev Employee Handbook. Channels for filing complaints are publicized through the company’s internal media.

# Breaches of Regulations and the Law

ThaiBev requires that all employees comply with its rules and regulations, and the laws of countries that ThaiBev operates in. Any breach of applicable regulations in terms of ethics, organizational standards of excellence, or violations of human rights on the business premises must be stopped immediately and appropriate measures taken. In 2019, some minor cases were reported. Breaches were categorized by the monetary value of the action. Major cases involve a monetary value of 300,000 baht or more; minor cases involve less than 300,000 baht. To prevent breaches of the regulations, ThaiBev has implemented the following procedures to prevent corruption:

*Note: More details on minor and major cases of regulations and laws violation can be found at www.sustainability.thaibev.com*

# Corruption Reducing Guideline

1. ThaiBev provides orientation to new employees and executives.
2. Online training courses are provided.
3. ThaiBev communicates business ethics to employees and executives and makes efforts to ensure that they understand.
4. ThaiBev strives to communicate the Code of Business Conduct to employees and executives and make sure they understand they are required to follow the code.
5. If fraud is discovered, decisive action will be taken. This may involve legal action.
6. Internal audits for corruption is conducted on regular basis.

# Adapting to Regulatory Change

Last year, the government revised laws concerning water regulations and strengthened protections for employees, among others. These changes may affect ThaiBev’s exposure to risks, or could lead to the loss of certain business opportunities. ThaiBev therefore will conduct a complete review of its policies and operations to abide by the aforementioned laws, as follows:

- **Water Resources Act B.E. 2561**  
  This Act is a law related to the allocation, consumption, development, management, restoration, and conservation of water resources, and water rights, effective January 27, 2019. The sections of the law related to water allocation and consumption, water usage permit requests and issuance, and the collection of water fees will come into effect on January 27, 2021. Obtaining a water usage permit requires a water management plan. ThaiBev Group has drafted water management plans that use the principle of the 3Rs to reduce water usage, reuse and recycle water, by taking the following actions:
  - Digging wells to store water from both rainwater and public water sources, while taking into consideration the potential impact on the communities surrounding ThaiBev Group facilities.
  - Building walls to prevent flooding of ThaiBev Group facilities and to prevent leakage of waste from factories into flood waters, to avoid negative impacts on surrounding communities.
  - Reducing the use of groundwater to prevent land subsidence and to prevent saltwater intrusion into aquifers.
  - Digging ponds to collect rainwater and replenish groundwater.
  - Reusing treated water to water plants and cleaning.
  - Reusing water in a manner that does not reduce the quality or safety of ThaiBev products.

- **Revenue Code Amendment Act (No. 47) B.E. 2561**  
  This Act is a measure to prevent the unethical fixing of transfer prices between related companies or juristic partnerships. This law is not effective until the 2020 accounting period. But in order to ensure maximum transparency, ThaiBev Group has hired a consultant to examine these transactions between ThaiBev-related entities to certify that the prices agreed upon are based on the ‘Arm’s Length Price principle’. (The Arm’s-Length Principle of transfer pricing states that the amount charged by one related party to another for a product must be the same as if the parties were not related, e.g., the same price that would be charged on the open market). ThaiBev has already prepared transfer pricing documents for the whole group and each subsidiary company, starting with the non-alcoholic beverage business group.

- **Labor Protection Act (No. 7) B.E. 2562**  
  This Act specifies that employees are entitled to take up to three paid days per year for personal business leave. Furthermore, it states that a pregnant employee may take up to 98 days of maternity leave for each pregnancy (including leave for prenatal screenings), with wages paid for no more than 45 days. New compensation rates for employees who have worked continuously for more than 20 years have also been set. The Act also amended the rules for relocating an enterprise to include a relocation to a new location or other location owned by the employer. ThaiBev has amended the Group’s work regulations to comply with the law and offer more benefits to employees. In order to comply with the amended labor law, the Group has provided additional benefits to employees as follows:
  - Employees are entitled to take up to six days per year for personal business leave but only up to three paid days.
  - Maternity leave has been increased to 100 days, with wages paid not exceeding 55 days.

*Note: More details on ThaiBev Group’s Water Management Policy can be found in the Water Stewardship section on pages 54-59.*

## Land and Buildings Tax Act B.E. 2562

This Act came into effect on March 13, 2019. However, taxes on land and buildings will be collected in 2020. ThaiBev is aware of the changes in the taxation of land and buildings and has a policy to manage the land and buildings owned to meet the conditions of the law and to generate economic value for the company, employees, communities, and the country. ThaiBev provides an opportunity for employees or their families to rent areas owned by the company to increase their income and to build a stronger relationship with the Group. It also encourages the villagers in the communities around the Group’s facilities to rent agricultural land for farming. The Group already has provided 14 employees and their families, 23 villagers around the operational facilities, and one other person, with a rental contract covering a total area of 624 rai of land.

## Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562

This Act came into effect on May 28, 2019. However, the rules regulating the protection of personal data, the rights of personal data owners, complaints, civil liability, and penalties will come into effect on May 28, 2020. The law defines the duties of personal data controllers, such as data security, and granting rights to inspect, edit and delete information for personal data owners. The assessment of the data protection standards then places emphasis on the protection of personal data. ThaiBev will specify a form of requesting consent from the personal data owner, a process to support the exercise of other rights of the data owners, and data transfer between business units. It will also establish a privacy policy to protect the security of personal information in accordance with the new standards.

## ThaiBev and Public Policy

ThaiBev is committed to conducting its business according to the principles of good governance, by focusing on integrity and transparency, with a framework of fairness and accountability. ThaiBev coordinates with and supports various governmental organizations with the aim to increase competitiveness, strengthen its partnership network, and enhance opportunities for growth. The agencies that ThaiBev has made major contributions to in the past year include the Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand, the Federation of Thai Industries, the Thai–UK Business Leadership Council (TUBLC), and the Thai-Vietnamese Business Council. In 2019, ThaiBev collaborated with these agencies in the following ways:

1. For commercial benefits and to strengthen competitiveness, ThaiBev became a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and Board of Trade of Thailand, and the Thai–UK Business Leadership Council (TUBLC). ThaiBev received information about industrial developments and government regulations and provided input and suggestions about how certain policies can benefit both consumers and the industrial sector.

2. To further expand ThaiBev’s growing network of companies in the food and beverage industry, the company supported activities and events, participated in knowledge-sharing, and/or provided financial support to strengthen existing government and private sector policies that would be beneficial for the entire industry to grow stronger, more sustainable and stable.

# Examples of support for various organizations

- **The Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand**  
  ThaiBev provides financial support in the form of a membership fee and facilitates the promotion of practices that align with government policies. This includes announcements from the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministerial Regulations, and Excise Regulations. ThaiBev participates in the Annual General Meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Thailand, staying informed about changes in regulations and specifications. This enables ThaiBev to develop measures to mitigate impacts on business and formulate plans to manage changes for the industry's benefit.

- **The Thai Institute of Packaging and Recycling Management for Sustainable Environment (TIPMSE), through the Federation of Thai Industries**  
  ThaiBev supports the promotion of the 3Rs principles: reduce, reuse, and recycle. The company organizes campaigns and public relations to raise awareness of waste separation and has built a learning center for managing used packaging. ThaiBev promotes packaging management under the concept of Closed Loop Packaging (CLP) using recycled packaging. This aligns with SDG Goal 12 on Sustainable Production and Consumption through education, promotion, and connection.

- **The Federation of Thai Industries**  
  ThaiBev supports the Federation by building a new smart office and providing research funds for packaging management. ThaiBev also supports the Federation’s annual operations, such as the "Annual Red Cross Fair," and works on policies to enhance industrial efficiency and strengthen new entrepreneurs.

- **Thai-UK Business Leadership Council: TUBLC**  
  Joining TUBLC enabled ThaiBev to become aware of economic trends, trade policies, and factors affecting international trade and investment. ThaiBev exchanged views on joint investment challenges to plan for greater potential and competitiveness.

- **Thai-Vietnam Business Council**  
  ThaiBev is a board member of the Thai-Vietnam Business Council, aiming to increase trade and investment relations and facilitate technology transfer and information exchange between partners.

# LRQA Assurance Statement

Relating to Thai Beverage Public Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for the financial year 2019 (1 October 2018 – 30 September 2019)

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Thai Beverage Public Company Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.

## Terms of Engagement

Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by Thai Beverage Public Company Limited (ThaiBev) to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report for the financial year 2019 ("the Report") against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s verification approach. LRQA’s verification approach is based on current best practice and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) - Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Reliability of performance data and processes defined in ISAE3000.

Our assurance engagement covered ThaiBev’s operations and activities in Myanmar, United Kingdom and Thailand, including its subsidiary companies and specifically the following requirements:

- Looking at how ThaiBev has used the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, 2016 to prepare this Report; especially whether they followed the Universal standard for:
  - Stakeholder Inclusiveness and Materiality (reporting principles)
  - GRI 102-18 Governance Structure

- Evaluating the reliability of data and information for the following selected specific standards:
  - **Economic:**
    - GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed
      - Note: Revenues, operating costs and community investment only
  - **Environmental:**
    - GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization
    - GRI 302-3 Energy intensity
    - GRI 305-1 Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions
    - GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions
    - GRI 305-4 GHG intensity
    - GRI 303-3 Water withdrawal (2018 edition)
    - GRI 303-4 Water discharge (2018 edition)
    - GRI 303-5 Water consumption (2018 edition)
    - GRI 306-2 Waste by type and disposal method
  - **Social:**
    - GRI 403-8 Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system (2018 edition)
    - GRI 403-9 Work-related injuries (2018 edition)
    - GRI 403-10 Work-related ill health (2018 edition)
    - GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee
    - GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews
    - GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs.

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s operations and activities outside of Myanmar, United Kingdom and Thailand.

LRQA’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

## LRQA’s Opinion

Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information for the selected specific standards
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the Verifier.

*Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.*

## LRQA’s Approach

LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with LRQA’s Report Verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Reviewing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement and determining material issues to confirm that this information had been used to prepare their Report. We did this by comparing reports written by ThaiBev’s peers to establish whether the majority of sector issues were included in this Report.

*This document is subject to the provision on page 2.*

# Lloyd's Register LRQA

- **Checking whether ThaiBev had followed GRI’s Universal Standard for disclosing their Governance Structure.**  
  We did this by confirming that sustainable development was part of ThaiBev’s senior management’s responsibility.

- **Auditing ThaiBev’s data management systems** to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or misstatements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling processes and systems. We also spoke with key people in various facilities responsible for compiling the data and drafting the Report.

- **Confirming the reliability of the selected specific standards’ data by sampling evidence at:**
  - Spirit Plants:
    - Red Bull Distillery Co., Ltd., Samut Sakhon Province, Thailand
    - Grand Royal Group, Yangon, Myanmar
    - Inver House Distillers Limited, Scotland, United Kingdom
  - Beer Plant:
    - Beer Thip Brewery Co., Ltd., Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, Thailand
  - Non-Alcoholic Beverage Plant:
    - Sermsuk Public Company Limited, Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand
  - Food Manufacturing Plant:
    - Oishi Food Service Co., Ltd., Banbueng District, Chonburi Province, Thailand
  - Distribution Centre:
    - Thai Beverage Logistics (TBL) Regional Distribution Centre, Lampang Province, Thailand.

**Note:**
1. LRQA did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations.
2. LRQA did not visit the plant in the United Kingdom. Data for this location was reviewed remotely.

## Observations

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:

- **Inclusivity:**
  - We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from ThaiBev’s engagement process.

- **Materiality:**
  - ThaiBev has processes for identifying and determining material issues; the evaluation process considers factors such as stakeholder concerns, business risks and legal compliance and we are not aware of any major material issue having been excluded. However, we believe that future reports should also address issues in the supply chains such as water stress management and contractors’ occupational health and safety.

- **Responsiveness:**
  - ThaiBev and its subsidiaries have processes for responding to various stakeholder groups. We believe that ThaiBev should quantitatively evaluate the impacts associated with ThaiBev’s response throughout its stakeholder groups.

- **Reliability:**
  - ThaiBev use well designed templates to collect and calculate the data and information for the selected specific standard disclosures. ThaiBev should internally verify its own data management systems to further improve data reliability and ensure consistent reporting methodologies across all of its operations; for example, GHGs and waste disposal.

## LRQA’s Competence and Independence

LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.

This verification is the only work undertaken by LRQA for ThaiBev and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
