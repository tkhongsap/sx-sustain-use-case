I am excited to report that Thai Beverage Public Company Limited ("**ThaiBev**") has made substantial progress towards fulfilling our goal of becoming the stable and sustainable total beverage leader in the ASEAN market by 2020 and we are now a member of both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ("**DJSI**") for World and the DJSI for Emerging Markets. Significantly, we attained perfect scores in almost twice as many of the assessment areas compared to last year. Our remarkable inclusion in the component of the DJSI World Index after only one year from our inclusion as a member of the DJSI for Emerging Markets is the result of our complete commitment to achieving our "Vision 2020" objectives, which have been clearly laid out under five imperatives – growth, diversity, brands, reach, and professionalism. With this ranking upgrade, ThaiBev has achieved a higher standing in the international arena as an organization that delivers growth in a sustainable manner to maximize long-term benefits for stakeholders. This accomplishment is not only encouraging; it also spurs us to enhance our commitment to sustainable development and policies.

We continue to focus on "Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth" among all stakeholders, including those within our company, in the communities where we operate and other areas across Thailand. This is being achieved through our corporate social responsibility initiatives and our support of the Thai government’s Pracharath program.

ThaiBev’s journey towards greater sustainability is guided by the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy ("**SEP**") of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej Borommanathbophit and inspired by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals ("**SDGs**"), which can be viewed from three perspectives. From an economic perspective, we believe in long-term business commitments with a clear framework for financial discipline. From an environmental perspective, we look to implement green policies along our entire value chain. From a social perspective, we focus on working with communities to help create value and drive growth. The SEP principle is the cornerstone of our support of SDGs.

One of the major commitments undertaken by ThaiBev in 2017 revolves around participating and supporting the Pracharath program, a government initiative for the public sector, private sector, academic circle, civil sector and the community to work together, in order to drive the country’s economic development, especially in rural areas.

ThaiBev has helped to form a nation-wide network of area-based social enterprises, including Pracharath Rak Samakkee (Social Enterprise) (Thailand) Co., Ltd. and 76 other social enterprises. These 77 social enterprises provide business guidance to communities in three income-generating areas – agriculture, value-added products and community-based tourism. We assist them in facilitating improvements in five areas – access to factors of production, creating know-how, marketing, communication and creating awareness of sustainability and management.

Inclusive growth is the heart of sustainability. In 2017, government efforts have helped generate local economic growth, as evident from the over 23% increase in community product sales (OTOP). This enables local communities to improve their quality of life and leads towards the achievement of the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development goals.

We have also continued to embrace the Global Reporting Initiative ("**GRI**") and focus on economic, environmental, social, as well as the arts and cultural areas in this respect. ThaiBev also supports a range of projects that directly address issues such as climate change, community well-being, sports, public health and education, as well as arts and culture.

Great opportunities lie ahead for ThaiBev. We are encouraged by what we have achieved and motivated to further our sustainable business practices. We are firmly committed in our drive for corporate excellence in order to become the leading stable and sustainable total beverage company in the ASEAN market by 2020.

# Board Statement

The ThaiBev Board (the "Board") is committed to improving the sustainability of the ThaiBev Group (the "Group"). Sustainability considerations, including environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues, are integral and essential matters which we take into account in our formulation of the overall strategy for the Group. We are fully supportive of all efforts by ThaiBev’s management team to make improvements in this area.

Furthermore, as the Group’s long-term sustainability is a key priority for the Board and as efforts in this respect depend on the management team’s implementation and operational abilities, the Board has made it clear that our evaluation of their performance takes their effectiveness in delivering on the commitments made to sustainability initiatives and targets in this report into account.

The Board is committed to being transparent, clear and open about the ThaiBev’s businesses to its shareholders and other stakeholders.

In this report, we have discussed ThaiBev’s efforts to continue building on and strengthening the Group’s collaboration with business partners to drive positive economic, environmental, and social impact throughout its value chain with good governance.

The Board has assigned responsibility for overseeing ThaiBev’s sustainability initiatives and the preparation of this sustainability report to the Group’s corporate sustainability development committee and working team. The Board receives regular reports and presentations from the committee and the ThaiBev management team on their sustainability objectives, targets, initiatives, challenges, progress and achievements, as well as the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors of relevance to the Group. We will continue our efforts on this front so as to further enhance ThaiBev’s sustainability.





# Creating and Sharing the Value of Growth

As the region’s leading beverage company, ThaiBev’s dimension of ‘growth’ covers growth in both sales revenue and brand diversification in order to further accommodate our partners and consumers.

This means that we must take into account another dimension in which our partners and co-workers perform better and with more efficiency to simultaneously benefit from creativity and good intentions.

Furthermore, we take into our consideration the value everybody receives through our products and our multi-dimensional contributions to society from the environment, education, sports, and culture. With this, ThaiBev hopes to create a ripple of endless happiness that can be shared by all.

# ThaiBev Value Chain

## 1. Sourcing

To drive sustainable sourcing in an efficient manner and to develop partnership standards for sustainable growth, ThaiBev has put in place mechanisms for risk management in goods and services, in tandem with risk management for trade partners who take part in the sourcing of raw materials. ThaiBev screens partners to ensure that their work meets both environmental and social standards. All this ensures that products that enter consumers’ hands are safe and of high quality.

## 2. Production

In every stage of the manufacturing process, ThaiBev cares about safety and is conscientious about the use of various resources like water and energy, ensuring that it provides good value and maximum benefit without polluting the environment and surrounding communities. ThaiBev follows legal standards and international standards, including ISO 9000, GMP, HACCP, and ISO 14000, and has received the NSF drinking water quality certification from the National Sanitation Foundation in the United States. In addition, ThaiBev continually develops innovations and technology to ensure that its products achieve the highest quality and adhere to the highest standards, all without negatively affecting the environment and the organization’s stakeholders.



### Visual Representation

- **2. Production**
- **5. Post-Consumption Packaging Management**

[Infographic: ThaiBev Value Chain showing the flow from sourcing to production and post-consumption packaging management.]

# Distribution

ThaiBev prioritizes good planning and strong, comprehensive distribution channels, ensuring that merchandise reaches its destination on time and in high quality. ThaiBev remains cognizant of accidents that might happen during transportation, and consequently, it has put modern technology to use in management, for example, to monitor the driving discipline of delivery drivers, and to efficiently manage fuel. As a result, the Company can control and manage the impact on different aspects of the business for stakeholders effectively.

# Marketing and Sales

ThaiBev delivers products for the consumer through efficient distribution channels by building strong networks and focusing on building good relationships with business partners through a variety of projects, such as "The Agent 'Next Gen'", which is part of the strategies of our Vision 2020. In addition, ThaiBev demonstrates its responsibility to the consumer and society through public relations, whether by using product labels which identify all nutritional details, or by organizing "Serve Responsibly" workshops or organizing sales promotions to build relationships with the consumer. At the same time, the Company remains open to consumer feedback through various channels, so as to guide product development that fully responds to the demands of the consumer.

# Post-consumption Packaging Management

With the belief that good packaging should not only protect the product and make it look pleasing, but also be reusable in the manufacturing process (using materials and packages such as paper boxes, cushioning, glass bottles, and plastic), ThaiBev designs packaging made of reusable materials, to reduce waste arising from consumption, since "single-use" disposability makes too much trash and wastes natural resources in the manufacturing of these materials.

# The ThaiBev Sustainability Approach

## Sustainable Development Strategy

ThaiBev embraces King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), in tandem with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. The Company incorporates them into its corporate guidelines to push forward its business operations in a responsible manner for society and all stakeholders.

The Sustainability Economy Philosophy framework, when put to use in business planning and operations, consists of the following 3 principles: Moderation, Reasonableness, and Prudence. If the Company abides by these 3 principles with knowledge and virtue, it will be able to remain stable and sustainable through the currents of globalization and change.

## Business Operations Principles

Business operations should be founded on the basis of the middle path as exemplified in the three major parts of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, which are:

### Moderation
- Work following one's abilities and potential
- Avoid extremes
- Exercise financial discipline

### Reasonableness
- Assess the reasons for every action affecting stakeholders
- Create real, authentic value

### Prudence
- Manage risk
- Prepare for future impacts or changes

Aside from these three principles, ThaiBev adheres to two conditions governing the principles, completing the diagram of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. The conditions are the use of knowledge and virtues for business planning, decision making, and various operations activities.

### Knowledge
- In-depth information
- Correct understanding
- The linking together of knowledge and experience

### Virtues
- Integrity
- Sincerity
- Diligence
- Self-awareness
- Humility

# The Adoption of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy

The adoption of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy as a business strategy will lead to balanced progress in all 4 dimensions: economy, society, environment, and culture. At the same time, under its sustainable development strategy, ThaiBev is confident that it will be able to be self-sustaining and develop limitless opportunities for the business and society as a whole.

## Key Dimensions

- **Economy**  
  Creating business value

- **Environment**  
  Managing the impacts from business

- **Society**  
  Caring and sharing

- **Culture**  
  Promoting artistic and cultural conservation

## Sustainable Development Goals

In addition to applying SEP to its business approach, ThaiBev also aims to abide by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Merging these two frameworks provides an approach for increasing the efficiency of many aspects of ThaiBev’s operations, and it promotes sustainable development at the domestic and international levels. These two frameworks focus on the usage of knowledge, experience, and thinking to achieve steady growth, the reduction of environmental impact, and the development of human resources. Nevertheless, any sustainable form of economic growth must be built on the foundations of reasonable business operations and appropriate risk management.

SEP and SDGs are consistent with ThaiBev’s Vision 2020, and the Company’s aim to become “a stable and sustainable leader in the beverage business in ASEAN,” focusing on participating in the building of stronger relationships with stakeholders sustainably, in lock-step with the growth of the organization.

All together, ThaiBev is confident that sustainable development strategies, built on the foundations of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, will result in balanced progress for the Company throughout the value chain and promote business operations with the maximum benefit for society, the environment, and the key stakeholders of the organization.

# The Process for Assessing Key Sustainability Issues

1. **Identification of Issues**
   - The Company selects sustainability issues that are consistent with business operations, based on information gathered from executives and experts from every business unit and relevant units, and from interviews of external experts on sustainability in the context of food and beverage business sustainability. This involves learning about global trends and changes, sustainability issues of other companies in the industry, as well as a survey of stakeholders on corporate sustainability issues.

2. **Issue Prioritization**
   - The Company takes the identified issues and ranks them by priority, considering each issue’s impact on the Company’s business operations, and the opinions of all stakeholders about the possible impact. The result is an ordered set of significant corporate sustainability issues.

3. **Validation**
   - The Corporate Sustainability Development Working Team cross-checks the comprehensiveness of the key corporate sustainability issues, and presents the completed list to the Corporate Sustainability Development Committee for review and approval. It then presents the issues to the Board of Directors for final approval and implementation.

4. **Establishment of Reporting Boundary**
   - The Company determines the scope of the reporting of all 20 key issues, based on the information collected from various agencies and relevant stakeholder groups.

5. **Continuous Development**
   - The Company is committed to continuously operating under the sustainable development framework, by taking into account stakeholders’ perspectives on key issues in the development of appropriate and fair sustainability practices.

**Martin Hart-Hansen**  
Deputy Resident Representative  
UNDP Thailand

"Two areas of focus come to mind when looking at ThaiBev’s potential contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals, which would also have a positive impact on ThaiBev’s business and reputation as a sustainability leader in Thailand: Sustainability of Agricultural Inputs, and Water Conservation and Management. Two major inputs into ThaiBev’s production are sugar and water, and while ThaiBev already has sustainability initiatives related to these, I would welcome an even stronger engaging in sustainability initiatives at the very primary level of the supply chain: Working with sugar cane farmers to produce sustainably, including helping farmers cope with the effects of climate change, and working with communities along major rivers to improve water quality and thereby quality of life for communities as well as the rich biodiversity in Thailand’s rivers. This is about taking responsibility for every step in the supply chain. From farm/community to consumer."



**Dr. Banthun Sethsathirot**  
Deputy Director, Prime Minister Delivery Unit: PMDU

"Regarding social and environmental issues that ThaiBev should first consider, the company can start with looking at its core business and compare it to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and see which goal it matches. Considering the business of ThaiBev, the SDG that is most relatable is Goal 12, which is about sustainable consumption and production. ThaiBev should look at its core business to see which activities match the Goal. Apart from the management and considering the value chain, ThaiBev can start doing the “Data Flow Platform” to help both public and private sectors access the data and solve the problem of data being scattered. If there is a central hub for data like this, it will help those who are involved to know about the stage of operation and development of each other. This is truly a development. If the private sector can start this initiative, the public sector would definitely join it."

# Governance, Risk, and Compliance

**GRI 102-11, GRI 102-15, GRI 102-16, GRI 102-17, GRI 201-2, GRI 205-2, GRI 205-3, GRI 419-1**

ThaiBev prizes integrity, accountability, transparency, and fairness, abiding by its Business Codes of Conduct. Corporate governance is one of the key factors that improve organizational efficiency involving the relations between executives, board members, management, staff, and other stakeholders. Corporate governance creates important structures acting as mechanisms to determine business objectives, to determine the methods for achieving those objectives, and to monitor operating results. Consequently, the Company emphasizes principles of good corporate governance and appropriate risk management plans following sustainable development guidelines.

Good corporate governance is an internationally recognized approach to organizational management. Consistent with the Company’s Business Codes of Conduct, good corporate governance brings about fairness and transparency, which leads to trust among shareholders and all stakeholders. Moreover, it also enables the Company to achieve sustainable growth.

## The Company’s Good Corporate Governance

With commitment and determination, ThaiBev enacts good corporate governance in tandem with an efficient, transparent, and accountable system of management. That is to say, the Company not only abides by laws and regulations, but also aims to be a role model in professionalism in doing business, prioritizing transparency and good corporate governance in order to boost confidence among shareholders, investors, staff, customers, and all stakeholders.

Furthermore, the Company has detailed its good corporate governance in the 2017 Annual Report, which explains the structures and processes of revealing information regarding good corporate governance. The Report also reveals operating results and spells out guidelines for developing organizational sustainability in the relations between board members, executives, and shareholders of the Company, for competitiveness. The Company also prioritizes business capacity building for customers, in order to foster stable and sustainable growth, and to increase value for shareholders in the long term while keeping in mind all stakeholders, both inside and outside the organization. The Company routinely organizes training in legal issues and relevant regulations pertaining to the Singapore Exchange. Every year, the corporate governance unit under the Company’s Office of the Secretary organizes an information session for board members, management, and staff from relevant units in the ThaiBev Group. And whenever there is a relevant change in laws and regulations, the unit will inform the Company in the board meeting, in the executive committee meeting, or via email, depending on the case.

# Business Code of Conduct

Business ethics are a key part of enabling business growth, stability, sustainability, and acceptance from society. Consequently, ThaiBev has established its Business Codes of Conduct with the intention of emphasizing integrity, legal compliance, and the observance of morality and ethics, as stipulated by ThaiBev’s Codes. The executives, managers, and employees all have the responsibility to adhere to our Codes of Conduct, so that the Company achieves its objective in upholding ethical conduct and continuing to maintain its ethical standards.

ThaiBev has organized training workshops on the Business Codes of Conduct during new employee orientation. Through the website: sustainability.thaibev.com, every employee is encouraged to understand the Codes’ content and meaning more thoroughly. Every employee is also required to accept and strictly adhere to the moral and ethical values espoused in the Codes.

If all personnel involved in all parts of the Company conduct themselves with integrity and do their work under the framework of good governance, ThaiBev will be able to uphold its responsibility toward society and all stakeholders.

# Anti-Corruption

Recognizing the importance of transparency and morality in business, ThaiBev adheres to the framework of good corporate governance, under the principles of justice, ethics, and compliance with the Business Codes of Conduct, while striving for the highest benefits for all stakeholders. With this in mind, ThaiBev’s anti-corruption policy sets into motion practices to protect against corruption, and serves as a guideline for promoting business sustainability and stability in the future. The President and CEO has the duty to monitor and implement an efficient anti-corruption system, report to the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, and review the policy to be up-to-date and responsive to changes in business, regulations, standards, and laws.

Furthermore, the Company also assigns high-level executives the duty of creating an understanding of policy compliance among board members, supervisors, and employees, encouraging them to be vigilant and proactive in fighting corruption. Should a corrupt activity be witnessed, the witness is supposed to report it to their supervisor. Or should the wrongdoer(s) be found guilty, they will be punished according to the Company’s rules and subsequently prosecuted under the law.

# Complaint Handling

ThaiBev has a policy of complaint handling wherein all employees are encouraged to report suspicious activity if they witness actions that may consider wrongdoing. The Company, in turn, is charged with enacting punitive measures against such wrongdoing in a robust manner, and the reporting employee will be free from any blame or repercussions if the complaint is filed in good conscience. There is, furthermore, another channel for filing complaints on the website www.thaibev.com for stakeholders of all types.

The policy of complaint handling aims to address the complaints and take action against the suspect(s) expediently and appropriately. This policy applies to all levels of the organization, from executives to employees. The Company is ready and willing to protect employees who file plausible complaints, even if they turn out to result from a misunderstanding. Furthermore, the Company will take appropriate measures to protect executives and employees from harm and threat to personal safety resulting from filing the complaint.

# Breaching of the Regulations and the Law

ThaiBev requires that all employees will comply with organizational rules and regulations upholding to company’s Code of Conducts and laws of the countries that ThaiBev operates in. Any breach of the applicable regulations in ThaiBev’s operations will be decisively put to an immediate end and appropriate measures will be applied.

In 2017, some minor cases were reported. Breaches are categorized by the monetary values of the action. Major cases involve monetary values of 300,000 baht or more and minor cases involve less than 300,000 baht.

## Solutions:

1. The Company provides orientation to new employees and executives.

# Risk Management

ThaiBev emphasizes creating and sharing the value of stable and sustainable business growth for the organization’s stakeholders. Proper risk management is essential to business operations that face uncertainty and continual change, enabling the Company to accomplish its objectives and goals. It reduces losses, increases competitiveness, and/or creates new business opportunities for the organization. The key elements of a risk management framework are as follows:

1. **Risk Management Structure and Policy**
2. **Risk Management Process**
3. **Risk Culture within the Organization**

## Risk Management Structure

The risk management structure of the Company is divided into two levels: the corporate level and the product group or business unit level.

- **At the corporate level**: 
  - The Risk Management Committee (RMC)* comprises appointed directors and senior management from each product group or business unit.
  - Responsible for determining the Company’s risk management policy and framework, monitoring, reviewing, and providing comments and recommendations.

- **At the product group or business unit level**:
  - Senior executives of each product group or business unit control and track risk management and report to the RMC.

In addition to managing potential risks from normal operations, the Company also manages risks associated with strategic planning, investment, and business planning. Corporate risks are reported to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee to ensure all risks are managed according to determined measures.

## Risk Management Process

Risk management at the product group or business unit level consists of the following steps:

1. **Identify risks**: Identify risks that the Company faces or are latent in operations which could occur and adversely affect the achievement of Company objectives.
2. **Analyze and assess risks**: Analyze the causes, likelihood of occurrence, and the possible impact or severity of identified risks to classify and prioritize existing risks.
3. **Plan action**: Plan and determine the risk management actions.
4. **Implement**: Implement the risk management action plans.
5. **Monitor, control and measure**: Track risk management progress and assess results by comparing with key risk management indicators defined as criteria for performance evaluation of middle management.

### Remark

Following the end of the year ended 30 September 2017, the Board of Directors Meeting No. 5/2017 dated 23 November 2017 approved the transformation of the existing "RMC" to "Sustainability and Risk Management Committee ("SRMC")" and the revised scope of responsibilities to ensure that the Company can generate an overview of effective and efficient sustainability strategies.

# Risk Culture Within the Organization

To develop an understanding and instill risk management awareness as a part of corporate culture amongst all employees, ThaiBev regularly organizes training workshops for existing and new employees to understand the organization’s risk factors, processes of risk management and tools for managing risks, both generally and specifically. By doing so, employees will be prepared to cope with potential events affecting business operations in the short, medium and long term.

Employees can report potential risks to the organization in writing to their superiors or to the Office of the President and CEO through the dedicated email account, after which the President and CEO will consider and take further actions deemed appropriate.

# Potential Risks to The Sustainability of ThaiBev Group

According to macro-level analysis of future trends in economics, society and environment, there are 4 primary areas of change:

1. Demographic changes - population aging, growth of the middle class and urbanization
2. Climate change
3. Technological changes and increasing dependence on technologies, especially the internet
4. Shift in global economic power from the United States and Europe to Asia

Such changes could engender many kinds of risk, including risks to the economy, to corporate governance, to the environment, to safety and security, to health and to society. Together these are known as **"Emerging Risks"**, which present obstacles that may affect the attainment of business goals, the Company’s reputation and the stability and sustainability of the organization.

![Sustainability Risks Diagram](#)

- **Society**
- **Economy**
- **Corporate Governance**
- **Environment**
- **Safety and Security**
- **Health**

Therefore the Company has come up with the following approaches to the management of emerging risks for all product groups, so as to reduce loss or adverse effects that might occur, while at the same time enhance the competitiveness of ThaiBev Group.

# Demographic Changes

## Risks and Impacts

- Consumer behavior becoming increasingly health-conscious constitutes a risk if the Company cannot adapt to consumer behavior and/or demands.
- Demands for increasingly diverse, high-quality, high-standard, or innovative goods and services among middle-income and high-income consumers, which include consumers in large cities. If the Company cannot respond promptly, it will miss and lose opportunities, competitiveness and/or market leadership.
- Increasingly strict laws and regulations concerning consumer goods or goods which affect the health of consumers leading to legal compliance risk. If the Company is found to be non-compliant or only partially compliant, it could affect the Company’s reputation, or result in punishment and penalties.

## Management

- Research and develop healthy food and beverages in accordance with ThaiBev’s health and nutrition policy.
- Develop and invest in the food business in the form of diverse restaurants that can appeal to different groups of customers, so as to expand the business overall and support the beverage business.
- Implement a “Central Kitchen” for managing the food business, from purchasing and using raw materials, to managing and reducing the quantity of food waste.
- Prioritize the distribution channels of Hotels, Restaurants and Cafes (HORECA), which are consistent with the behavior of middle-income and high-income consumers.
- Design and develop labels and packaging that communicate nutritional value and information about the Company’s food and beverages.
- Provide product information through communications technology to reach target consumers in ways that correspond to their behavior and lifestyles.
- Train and educate employees in various departments involved in business development and expansion both domestically and internationally on trends and significant changes in the economy, society and environment.

# Climate Change

## Risks and Impacts

- Environmental degradation, e.g., deforestation, water and air pollution.
- Severe weather events and failure to alleviate or adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
- Water, food and energy crises, which will impact the Company’s supply chain, from procurement, to production, shipping and sales.
- Uncertainty and change in the quantities available and price of agricultural goods may impact upon, the Company’s raw materials.
- The various forms of environmental conservation movement and the increasing strictness of environmental regulations.
- Financial losses due to fines and loss of reputation if the organization negatively impacts the environment and ecosystems.

## Management

- Every business group must strictly comply with the organization’s environmental and water management policies, e.g., implementing the ISO 14001 environmental management system, adopting the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), reserving sufficient water for production, taking part in the Water Footprint and the Carbon Footprint projects at the corporate and product levels, using modern and energy saving equipment in the treatment and removal of factory wastewater. Furthermore, various renewable energy projects have been developed as an alternative source of energy for manufacturing.
- Use of modern, energy saving production technology and machinery to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the use of natural resources and energy. Together this helps reduce costs or input in the production process, and increases production efficiency and effectiveness.
- Support the development of environmentally friendly packaging in order to reduce costs or input and increase effectiveness and efficiency during production and shipping, as well as improving the image of the brand.
- Manage in accordance with the Suppliers’ code of practices on environmental and sustainable development.
- Continuous analysis and tracking of changes in price and available quantities of raw materials, in order to improve management and performance across the value chain.
- Develop the consolidated strategic sourcing and procurement system across the ThaiBev Group network.

# Innovation

Innovation is an important part of the value chain that ensures ThaiBev’s success in the food and beverage industries. Accordingly, the Company emphasizes research and development of new products to increase commercial variety and to respond to the demands of the consumer. At the same time, research and development also helps improve efficiency and quality in production and services for customers and consumers. This allows for a better response to changes which may increase the risk of business as well as changes in consumer behavior in the digital age.

## Process Innovation

ThaiBev has improved efficiency through new innovations in the Company’s processes. These innovations will help push the Company to put its resources to good use, increase quality control standards for goods and services, as well as increase production rate and reduce environmental impact for the benefit of all stakeholders. In 2017, ThaiBev has developed the following innovations:

### BevTech

ThaiBev has established BevTech Co. Ltd. by selecting a team of competent engineers from various departments to participate in the research and development of machinery and robotics throughout the manufacturing process. BevTech’s budget is allocated to investment for selecting technology and innovations that are appropriate for the situation and the business environment, to increase efficiency and quality in production, develop advanced technology, increase employee safety, mitigate the risk of labor shortages, and have a competitive advantage, which BevTech technology has brought to the factories of various business groups. The goal of the Company is to automate 80-90% of production in the factories of all business groups. At this time, Oishi factories are 90% automated and our breweries have already reached 80% automation.

# TOMS Mobile

TOMS Mobile is a digital system for examining user status and purchase orders via mobile phones. This system works with a vehicle’s location tracking system as well as the Safe Mate mobile application to identify the delivery vehicles’ location and track the driving behavior of delivery drivers. For example, the system can identify driving above the speed limit, route changes, and sudden stops or turns. Such information is compiled on a website and monitored by a delivery inspection unit. This innovation helps reduce the adverse effects on the community from the Company’s delivery vehicles, reduce fuel usage thanks to the planning of efficient delivery routes and also expedite delivery for the customer.

# Oishi Pointo Card

Oishi Pointo Card is a membership card taking the form of a mobile application designed to respond to future service demands of consumers. The system will allow for managing the provider-consumer relationship with greater efficiency. Through the Pointo Card application, the consumer can receive updates and special deals from restaurants in Oishi Group, examine their service history, find Oishi Group restaurants and accumulate points to exchange for special privileges.

# Management System of Restaurants in Oishi Group

ThaiBev recognizes the opportunity to improve waste management in the food businesses in Oishi Group. Accordingly, the Company has done in-depth information analysis to understand consumer behavior, and has also implemented technological solutions to create a system for restaurant operations and waste management. The system records the quantity and type of uneaten food left by consumers and identifies popular food items. The Company analyzes this information to develop a performance improvement plan to be as efficient as possible in overall service and in the use of ingredients. The Company may adjust a restaurant’s menu to better correspond to consumer preferences.

According to surveys of Oishi Eaterium and Shabushi restaurants done by an experienced survey company, 90% of consumers have increased satisfaction with the menu and services. The surveys may also help the Company choose food items which use ingredients most efficiently.

In addition, 2017 marked the beginning of the use of barcode cards and touch screens for ordering food at Oishi Eaterium. The purpose of this system is to control the amount of food customers may order each time, which is also a way for customers to help reduce food waste. The Company plans to open more branches of Oishi Eaterium in the future.

# Product Innovation

ThaiBev’s approach to new product development derives in part from the analysis of consumer feedback and behavior, gathered via channels such as social media, email, call center, as well as the results of in-depth market research and analysis. The Company takes this information to be used in product creation and development so as to better respond to consumer needs, especially young consumers who seek out new things and also prioritize products’ nutritional value.

## Oishi Sakura Strawberry

Oishi Sakura Strawberry is the first beverage product in Thailand to make use of thermochromic shrink labeling, which changes color to reflect changes in temperature. The sakura blossoms on the label noticeably change from white to pink when the bottle is chilled. This feature caters to young consumer groups who seek out new, exciting things for their lives.

# Open Innovation

ThaiBev’s center for research and development helps promote creative innovations for employees at all levels. There have also been external third-party collaborations with commercial partners, NGOs, and universities. These take the form of an “Open Innovation” model aimed at promoting knowledge and creativity to benefit the Company, society and the environment in concrete ways.

# Consumer Health, Safety, and Wellbeing

**GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 416-1, GRI 417-1**

Consumption of food and beverages which are nutritious and safe is an important factor for strengthening the body and ensuring the good health of the consumer. ThaiBev is accordingly dedicated to innovative product development and production processes which meet international safety standards. Selection of safe materials for the consumer is one part of responding to the problem of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) triggered by risk behaviors, such as diabetes and obesity.

In its health and nutrition policy, ThaiBev emphasizes three main aspects: the development of products that benefit the health of the consumer with an emphasis on reducing the use of sugar and the number of calories, the promotion of social awareness about healthful ThaiBev products, and the promotion of health literacy, to encourage health-conscious lifestyles and consumer behavior.

## Sourcing Safe Materials for the Consumer

ThaiBev is attentive to the selection of consumer-safe materials for use in production. The Company examines each material’s source, quality, and safety, in strict concordance with international standards. This includes screening processes where business partners are stipulated to disclose the information regarding the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in materials. Such information is displayed on the labeling of products in every country, following the Company’s policy and the regulations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives regarding the use and harvesting of materials with GMOs. Furthermore, ThaiBev also encourages the use of organic agricultural products from agricultural sources certified by consumer health and safety organizations.

# Healthy Products

ThaiBev continuously conducts research and studies to increase the percentage of healthy products it puts in the market. The Company works to promote healthy and nutritious alternatives without compromising flavor for the consumer.

![Vending Machine Image]

### 31%

In 2017, 7 out of ThaiBev’s 22 non-alcoholic beverages on the market (not including drinking water and mineral water), or 31%, were certified as a “Healthier Choice” by the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University.

ThaiBev is 70% of the way to its 2020 goal (67%) of increased healthy product options. This is made possible by ThaiBev’s dedication to the development of healthier products, answering the demands of consumers who are attentive to health and nutrition. In 2017, ThaiBev continued to develop new foods and beverages which conform to health and nutrition policies, as follows:

## 100 Plus Mixed Berry

A new flavor of 100 Plus – the caffeine-free carbonated isotonic beverage has been introduced to the consumer. Made with steviol glycosides, a natural sugar made from stevia, 100 Plus contains less than 50 percent of the calories and sugar in typical carbonated beverages.

## Chang Mineral Water

ThaiBev is expanding into the mineral water market. Chang Mineral Water is crafted from pure mineral water extracted from a groundwater aquifer in Aguthaya province that contains various accumulated minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and fluoride. The mineral water is put through a triple filtration process to make the water clean and pure, while still containing all the minerals necessary for the body. Further, the water has been certified by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) of the United States.

## Oishi Sandwich Plus

A new ready-to-eat product for the health-conscious consumer who demands high-quality and low-calorie food. ThaiBev has developed a recipe for multi-grain bread which contains nutrition from four carefully selected grains: wheat, malted barley, riceberry and soybean. This is combined with other quality ingredients, such as low-fat and high-protein chicken breast.

## Oishi Riceberry Gyoza

Oishi Riceberry Gyoza comes from carefully selected high-quality ingredients. The riceberry flour is sourced from Thai organic rice fields under the supervision of the Friends in Need of (“Pa”) Volunteers Foundation of the Thai Red Cross. Oishi Riceberry Gyoza is made from a kind of rice flour with high nutritional value and nutrients for the body, such as vitamin B1, vitamin E, iron, omega 3 fatty acids and dietary fiber. Through innovative application, the rice flour is processed into sheets of gyoza wrappers. One package of Oishi Riceberry Gyoza has only 190 kilocalories.

ThaiBev informs the consumer about health-promoting products as well as nutritional information, such as sugar and sodium content in products. At the same time, the Company provides the consumer with nutrition information in accordance with the pertinent laws and regulations.

# Responsible Consumption

Thai Beverage Public Company Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively “ThaiBev”), the world-class producer and distributor of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, aim to create high-quality products of all product groups for our consumers. As outlined in ThaiBev’s Vision 2020, ThaiBev strives to accomplish efficient growth and to diversify our market and product groups. We also guarantee brand satisfaction, while simultaneously attending to the responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages by organizing campaigns and workshops with entrepreneurs and alcohol servers to educate those directly involved with consumers on various aspects of alcoholic beverages. The purpose of the activities organized by ThaiBev is to encourage to drink responsibly, take into account their health and safety along with the safety of society. These activities include:

## Serve Responsibly Project

The Serve Responsibly Project was first introduced in 2016 with the aim to raise alcohol servers’ awareness of their responsibilities to society, emphasizing the importance of customers’ welfare and safety. To promote the responsible serving of alcohol, ThaiBev has organized the “Serve Responsibly” workshops for servers of alcoholic beverages including food and beverage service managers, waiters, and hotel and premium restaurant bartenders. The objective of these workshops is to lower the risk of accidents associated with excessive alcohol consumption. Each workshop lasts 1 day, and covers the following topics:

- Knowledge with respect to the laws regulating alcoholic beverages, especially the Alcohol Control Act, B.E. 2551 (A.D. 2008), and the first-hand experiences from police officers overseeing the enforcement of land traffic laws.
- Knowledge from medical experts to create a better understanding of appropriate alcohol consumption (Standard Drink), which would be beneficial to consumers’ health.
- Knowledge about body reactions before and after excessive alcohol intoxication through the “Walking Drunk” activity which participants can try out intoxication-simulating “Drunk Buster Goggles”, enabling them to identify those customers with signs of intoxication.

In 2017, ThaiBev organized three consecutive “Serve Responsibly” workshops with a total of 200 alcoholic beverage servers participating, a number that reached our set goal. Next year, ThaiBev intends to extend the workshops to Greater Bangkok and major cities in each region of Thailand. ThaiBev strongly believes that each and every workshop participant will apply the knowledge gained to their work and to share their knowledge with others, hence the production, distribution and consumption of alcoholic beverages in overall aspects shall proceed in a socially responsible manner.

# "Spirit Induction Program"

The "Spirit Induction Program", a 3.5-day course, was organized for ThaiBev's 115 sales representatives. The program's main objective was to make representatives aware of their roles and duties as alcoholic beverage salespersons. During the program, the representatives were provided with updates on the laws regulating alcoholic beverages, in particular the rules and conditions governing labeling and packaging, along with penalty provisions regarding places and time during which the sales of alcoholic beverages are illegal, the persons prohibited from purchasing alcohol, and other practices prohibited by law. ThaiBev has a strong belief that the participating sales representatives will take the information they have received and apply it to their work, recognizing their role as well as fostering an awareness of their responsibilities to the general public.

# "Safe Driving with ThaiBev" Taxi Back Ads Project

To campaign the general public to drink responsibly with a view to lower road traffic accidents and enhance overall road safety, ThaiBev has collaborated with the public sectors and other private organizations to create the Taxi Back Ads project, using advertising space in the back of taxi-cabs as a channel to stimulate self-awareness and to remind drivers and passengers to be mindful of the importance of good discipline and behavior on the road. This project organized by ThaiBev has been ongoing since 2008, with 300 taxi-cab drinkers participating each year. At present, there are 3,000 participating taxi-cabs to cover the whole area of Greater Bangkok.

"This project made me realize that I am part of creating the self-awareness to provide the socially responsible service. I wish ThaiBev to continue organizing these good projects going forward."

# Sustainable Sourcing

**GRI 204-1, GRI 308-1, GRI 414-1**

Sustainable sourcing is an essential foundation for a sustainable supply chain as it is the first step in the life cycle of ThaiBev products. This is why the Company takes great care in selecting raw materials, goods, and services used in the manufacturing process. The Company has established a **Supplier Code of Practice** in order to communicate its expectations of suppliers, such that potential production, environmental, social, and business impact is minimized. A standard for screening suppliers is also established, with strict quality control taking into account environmental and social impact. To ensure that consumers receive high-quality products, ThaiBev has standardized its sourcing process, which evidences environmental and social responsibility throughout the supply chain. In addition, sustainable sourcing contributes to job creation, increases income in local communities, and stimulates the domestic economy.

## Commercial Risk Management in Sourcing

Risk management is one of the mechanisms that propels sustainable sourcing in an efficient direction. From the selection of raw materials to the performance assessment after purchase from suppliers, risks are assessed on the basis of pricing and available supply of goods and services, as well as suppliers’ capacity in delivering goods and services. The Company identifies its critical suppliers based on sourcing risk levels and the results are brought to bear on risk mitigation strategies.

### Procurement Spend from Critical Suppliers

- **Critical suppliers contributed to 27% of the total procurement spend in 2017.**

## Categories of Suppliers

The Company classifies its suppliers by merchandise category into two groups; namely direct materials and indirect materials. The procurement spend on direct materials sourced amounts to 75% of the total procurement spend in 2017.

| Procurement Spend Proportion by Category in 2017 | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **75%**                                         | **Direct Materials**<br>Consists of raw materials, packaging, and fuel. This includes malt, glass bottles, plastic bottles, corrugated cartons, and fuel oils. |
| **25%**                                         | **Indirect Materials**<br>Consists of construction, machinery, spare parts, information technology equipment, office and factory consumables, point-of-purchase and point-of-sale products, and services. This includes filling machines, date coding machines, computers, stationery, and personal protective equipment. |

# Sustainability Risk Management in Sourcing

To ensure that suppliers meet the expectations of the Supplier Code of Practice, ThaiBev incorporates the factor of sustainability, encompassing good corporate governance, the environment, and society as part of the sustainable sourcing process. From screening of suppliers prior to purchase, and performance assessment after purchase to monitoring and improving their performance continuously, sustainable sourcing enhances the efficiency of supply chain management to support corporate growth.

## Supplier Award Program

ThaiBev initiated the Supplier Award Program in 2017 with the objective of promoting supplier capacity building, stimulating business competition, and spurring innovation in the industry.

*President and CEO of Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, Mr. Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, presents a Supplier Award.*

Apart from the Supplier Award Program, the Company has created the website **Supplier Life Cycle Management (SLCM)** (slcm.thaibev.com) to enable suppliers to go through registration, performance assessment, and monitoring of their own performance through an online system. In addition, this system also allows for the review and confirmation of purchase orders, a mechanism designed to reduce procurement time, and increase business competitiveness through an automated system. Furthermore, SLCM also acts as a channel of communication between suppliers and ThaiBev, wherein suppliers may submit a complaint or a suggestion through this website.

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **100%**  | of the Company's suppliers in the spirit and beer business groups in 2017 use the system |
| **1,581** suppliers | receive SLCM system training via electronic means |
| **88%**   | of purchase orders are confirmed online in 2017 |
| **107** suppliers | receive SLCM system training workshops on site in 2017 |

# Non-tier 1 Supplier Management

As for suppliers who do not directly engage in business transactions with the Company (non-tier 1 suppliers), for instance the suppliers of suppliers, the Company is also mindful of their impact on the procurement process. The Company has established the criteria for risk assessment which identify critical non-tier 1 suppliers, based on both business and sustainability factors. For example, their impact on the Company’s income and marketing influence, their cooperation with sustainability development efforts in the supply chain, and the frequency of sustainability risks detected.

# Sourcing of High Quality and Consumer-Safe Raw Materials

Raw materials are key components in ThaiBev’s main products in the alcoholic business segment. The raw materials with the highest purchase value in procurement are molasses, malt, and broken-milled rice, all of which are used in the brewing and distilling processes. ThaiBev has established a **Sustainable Agriculture Guideline** to set a standard for the quality and safety of raw ingredients purchased from the Company’s suppliers, as well as for the sustainability in the agricultural sector. Such a code prioritizes the consideration of the environmental impact of agriculture, including pesticide control, water consumption efficiency, local agriculture promotion, and biodiversity conservation.

### Molasses

Molasses suppliers for the Company have been certified by Bonsucro, with a standard recognized by various groups of stakeholders in the sugarcane industry. The standard’s main objective is to reduce environmental and social impact from the production of sugarcane and in turn, the production of molasses.

### Malt

ThaiBev’s suppliers of malted barley, one of our key raw materials, are members of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform, an international organization with the objective of promoting sustainability in the agricultural sector.

### Broken-milled rice

The Company conducts strict quality inspection of broken-milled rice, especially in terms of chemical residues and extraneous materials, so as to ensure 100% safety of products.

# Procurement of Goods and Services From Local Suppliers

ThaiBev believes that a stable national economy begins with comprehensive income distribution to local communities so that they achieve self-reliance. Therefore, the Company consequently privileges suppliers operating in the vicinity of its factories. Not only does this practice contribute to local job creation and add value to raw materials in each locale, it also minimizes transportation-related pollution.

![95% of ThaiBev's suppliers are local suppliers by the year 2020](image-placeholder)

| Year | Local Suppliers | Local Purchase Value |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 2013 | 98%             | 77%                  |
| 2014 | 98%             | 91%                  |
| 2015 | 98%             | 92%                  |
| 2016 | 97%             | 87%                  |
| 2017 | 97%             | 97%                  |

# Strategy 1: Clear Structure and Roles

ThaiBev places importance on appropriate structures within the organization, with the aim of clearly laying down the responsibilities of each employee and efficiently connecting individuals, teams, and sections. In addition, our organizational structure is also a mechanism to serve the strategic plans of each line of work, which will lead to constant improvement and business competitiveness.

ThaiBev is committed to Product Group and Strategic Support Group structures, which encompass businesses within Thailand and abroad.

For human capital management, the Company has established the Human Capital Steering Committee to oversee the overall management of all ThaiBev employees. The structure has 3 elements as follows:

1. **Organization Development and Group Capabilities**

# Strategy 2: Market-oriented Compensation and Benefits

ThaiBev manages compensation equitably and can be benchmarked with other companies in the same industry. We provide benefits for the welfare of employees, such as medical expense support, annual health check-up, accident insurance, and life insurance.

In putting in place a system for compensation, ThaiBev has worked with a world-leading company in designing the method for providing compensation and benefits which are comparable to the appropriate market reference point and in line with the business of the Company. We appropriately combine fixed compensation and performance-based variable compensation, with an increasing proportion of variable compensation supporting the goal of becoming a high-performance organization.

Moreover, ThaiBev and its subsidiaries have put in place a job evaluation system consistent with international standards and our organization structure. In 2017, job evaluation has covered positions within and outside Thailand.

ThaiBev recognizes that creating incentives for committed employees is crucial. For the Company’s sustainability, we created a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) by engaging the management with business ownership through the Company’s shares as a reward for their continuous dedication and to maintain valuable human resources in the Company in the long term, which contributes to good business operation.

# Strategy 3: Recognition-based Performance Management

ThaiBev places emphasis on clarity in work objectives, believing in the “Power of Clarity” which will make a difference in the efficiency of teams and the organization in the long run.

# Managing Outcomes and Performance Assessment

ThaiBev has developed guidelines for goal setting and performance assessment in a systematic and concrete manner. The aim is to support employees as they pursue "limitless opportunities" within the organization.

## Goal Setting

- Supervisors and employees create clarity by setting targets under the SMART principle (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound).
- Communication between both sides and the whole team enables indicators and goals to cascade from the organization level to the individual level.
- This ensures coherence and focuses on the organization’s strategies.
- Clearly connecting goals in this top-down manner is crucial for achieving long-term objectives and value creation.

## Performance Assessment

- An opportunity for supervisors and employees to review goals, work outcomes, and capability development.
- Reviews occur twice yearly: mid-year and end of year.
- The mid-year review discusses goal progress, potential achievement, changing circumstances, and required support from supervisors.
- Ensures alignment of expectations and fosters relationships between employees, their bosses, and the organization.
- Year-end review evaluates outcomes according to SMART KPI and behaviors aligned with the company’s culture.

## Individual Development Plan (IDP)

- Employees have an IDP agreed upon with their superior, based on performance and career goals.
- The IDP connects to career aspirations and organizational goals, clarifying roles and responsibilities.
- Contributes to sustainable human capital management.

## Coherence in Policies

- Management, from middle level upward, must have goals in sustainability and people development, each weighted 10%.
- These goals affect employee compensation assessments and are cascaded to employees.
- Emphasizes each employee's role in making the organization sustainable.

# Strategy 4: Holistic High Performer Development

![Icon](image-placeholder)

## Investment in Employee Development

- **In 2017, ThaiBev has spent over 178 million Baht** in developing the capabilities of its employees.

- **In 2017, the average training hours for employees is 18 hours per person per year.**

## Continuous Capability Development

Continuous capability development is crucial for driving business growth. ThaiBev encourages employees to embrace limitless growth opportunities within the organization. Capability development is supported through Individual Development Planning (IDP) under the 70:20:10 principle:

- **70% is learning by doing**, such as undertaking new responsibilities, special projects, and learning through real practices.
- **20% is learning from others**, such as through coaching, being taught by experts, participating in clubs, hearing opinions, receiving advice from others, and learning from executives.
- **10% is learning through formal trainings**, such as attending training courses, taking e-learning, or short-term courses.

This principle leads to a more efficient learning process and contributes to a workforce with increased knowledge, capacity, and skills.

## Capability Development Programs

In 2017, ThaiBev's capability development programs are categorized into 4 types:

1. **Leadership Competency Development**
   - Available for all levels of employees.
   - Focuses on 5 levels of leadership: Responsibility, Relationships, Result, Regeneration, Respect.

2. **Core Competency Development**
   - Aims to improve management skills in core areas such as communication, collaboration, and creation.

3. **General Skills Development**
   - Improves skills in various fields, such as computer skills and English language skills.

4. **Functional Competency Development**
   - Available for employees in each business and unit to learn specifically in relation to their own agency and business.

The company also trains employees in business ethics regularly to foster understanding and communicate organizational policies via online training.

# Leadership and Competency Development

# Senior Executive Development Program (SEDP)

ThaiBev has developed the program in collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the concept of ThaiBev–NUS Global Executive Leaders Program "Realizing Vision 2020: Strategies for Sustainable ASEAN Leadership". In 2017, the aim to develop the capabilities of 24 executives from every business unit of ThaiBev in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia, to prepare them for leadership in regional and international businesses and follow the ThaiBev Vision 2020. The program was carried out through action-based learning and emphasizes the need to build relationships between participants from the different units in order to foster seamless cooperation in the future.

# ASEAN Management Development (AMD)

Is a collaboration between ThaiBev and C asean to broaden the horizons of executives by sharing experiences across cultures and discovering opportunities in expanding the business to ASEAN markets. This is the first time that 60 executives from ThaiBev and its subsidiaries both in Thailand and Malaysia have come together to learn, share experiences and perspectives, understand different languages and cultures, and explore markets, sales channels and business opportunities in ASEAN markets, particularly in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. The program also involves presentations to the CEOs of projects that can provide opportunities for business growth in the ASEAN markets.

# Management Development Program (MDP)

Is a collaboration with Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration, Chulalongkorn University, which has been running for 3 years since 2015. In 2017, 40 middle-level executives have participated in the program with the aim of creating understanding in principles of administration and leadership skills to prepare them to become high potential top executives. Participants give presentations to CEOs and teaching employees for their assessment and recommendations, so they are ready to put what they have learned into action.

Every program has a learning process which emphasizes communication and collaboration within ThaiBev groups, which consist of employees from various agencies and areas in Thailand and overseas. The programs also place importance on new creation and the widening of perspectives so that participants can adapt to changes and be responsive to the organization’s future growth.

# Example of Value Gained from Capability Development

ThaiBev monitors and measures benefits from training courses to evaluate their effectiveness. In 2017, the Company expanded the utilization of the 4DX program, which began in 2015 with the objective of improving efficiency in the working process, to cover all sections of Thai Beverage Logistics (TBL), a subsidiary of ThaiBev. Over 4,200 practitioners and

![4DX Award 2017](image-url)

Supporting employees participate in the program, which involves coaching skills to enable the supervisors to transfer and build capacity among the practitioners efficiently and adjust the employees' behavior in a way that human capital and work development is enhanced. In 2017, the 4DX program reduced the cost of operations by more than 23.1 million Baht.

Additionally, the Company has also gained a return from investing in the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) training course. With the cooperation of the Science and Technology Research Institute of King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok, the Company has organized knowledge-sharing activities among employees from the alcoholic beverages companies who take turns to present about their achievements in reducing energy waste, costs of raw materials and costs relating to employees, in order to develop human resources, continue the learning process and increase effectiveness in terms of production in a sustainable manner. This saved over 52 million Baht in production cost in 2017.

## Coaching and Mentoring

ThaiBev has provided the Coaching & Technique for Breakthrough Results (CTBR) training course for the executives by leading coach Dr. Peter Chee. The purpose is to create understanding of the importance of coaching, and discovering answers through creating inspiration. The job of the coach is to harness the team’s potential and provide advice that allows coaches to find solutions themselves. In 2017, 5 senior executives obtained the Master Coach and Train The Trainer levels, and are certified to train coaches within the organization. At present, 550 employees have been trained. By encouraging internal executives to be master coaches, the Company has saved the cost of hiring external lecturers by over 8.8 million Baht. The Company is in the process of communicating with and training the supervisors to be able to transfer what they have learned from the coaching course to their colleagues and intends to set this as a KPI.

# The Creation of Coaching Culture

ThaiBev created the Coaching Club in 2017 to provide an opportunity for those who passed the CTBR course to share experiences of the application of coaching in their work. Employees who are certified coaches have shared their knowledge and helped create coaching culture in a tangible way.

In addition, the Company invited Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, the world’s number 1 coach, and other internationally renowned coaches to speak to employees. To date, 890 employees have been trained.



# The Collaborative Program between Thai Beverage Logistics (TBL) and Khon Kaen University

Building on the success in the collaboration in logistics training course in 2015, which led to continuous improvement in the working process and the reduction of production cost by over 32.7 million Baht, ThaiBev continued the cooperation with Khon Kaen University in 2016 in organizing a course on logistics in 27 small programs. The programs engaged over 3,600 practitioners in regional distribution hubs in Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani and Lampang, and helped adjust work procedures to be more efficient, in terms of transport fuel, storage space and pallet renting, with the total of 11 million Baht during the reporting year. Employees will share their practical knowledge to expand the benefits to other areas.



## Mr. Kawinsak Kesornthong

(Assistant Director, Customer Management, Sales Channels Management Group)

Was a participant in the Asean Management Development (AMD) course. "This course has broadened my horizons in the areas of the economies, politics, society, and cultures in ASEAN countries, as well as the principles and ideas which are necessary for executive positions. Such knowledge can be applied in expanding the markets in ASEAN. The course also provided opportunities for participants to share their professional expertise in classes and through group work activities, which helped improve many of our skills, such as leadership, communication and cooperation, and management with limited employees."



## Ms. Wijaporn Wongsungnampewch

(Assistant Manager, Information Technology Office)

Was a scholarship recipient to study a Master’s degree in business administration (MBA) at the Australian National University in Australia in 2015. "This is a digital age where technology plays quite a big role in our works. My intention is to use the knowledge and skills I have gained from my study to improve the IT works and contribute to the development of the organization."

# Strategy 5: Proactive Succession and Workforce Planning

For the purpose of smooth succession of senior executives who are close to retirement, ThaiBev has drawn up a Succession Plan to continue the vision and commitment of the Company to all stakeholders, customers, and society, and maintain a good management culture. The succession plan consists of:

1. Specifying key positions
2. Identifying the selection criteria which include leadership characteristics suitable for key positions
3. Assessing the readiness of the executives to be promoted
4. Creating individual development plans, and regular monitoring.

The succession plan not only takes into consideration the organization’s current needs, but also future requirements.

ThaiBev has been able to find successors for **93%** of the positions required in the Succession Plan.

# Strategy 6: Talent Acquisition and Onboarding

Recruiting employees with potential and work experience is important to the organization in order to support long-term growth and its goal of becoming ASEAN’s leading employer by 2020. ThaiBev has taken various approaches in recruiting employees, such as organizing Job Fair activities in over 30 government and university premises around the country in 2017.

Moreover, ThaiBev has reviewed its hiring procedure regularly to recruit applicants with abilities and experience that match the Company’s needs. The Company also trains the interviewers to be able to create a positive image for the Company and have good relations with the interviewees. At the same time, ThaiBev encourages current employees to recommend qualified applicants for available positions under the “Puen Chuan Puen” or “Friends Inviting Friends” project. Applicants will go through a normal and transparent hiring procedure and the employee who makes the recommendation will be rewarded once the recommended applicant has been hired and worked with the Company for 6 months. In 2017, 306 new employees were hired through recommendations, which accounts for 6.7% of ThaiBev group new employees.

ThaiBev also has an Internal Job Posting channel for employees to apply for internal vacancies. This provides the opportunity for employees to advance and to develop capabilities in other areas of interest to them. In 2017, over 15% of internal vacancies were filled by ThaiBev’s employees.

# Strategy 7: Engaging Corporate Culture

The Company conducts an annual survey on employee engagement. In 2016, the Company adopted the evaluation method pioneered by Aon Hewitt to assess factors affecting employee engagement in six areas:

- Company's operation
- Basic benefits
- Work context
- Leadership
- Outcome of human capital management
- Company's reputation and image

In 2017, results indicated that employee engagement exceeded the target. An in-depth analysis was conducted to improve human resources management and foster greater engagement. The Company aims for 80% employee engagement by 2020.

Additionally, ThaiBev's executives have emphasized the importance of work improvement to enhance employee engagement by focusing on:

- Employees' benefits
- Working conditions
- Remuneration
- Roles in the organization
- Recognition for their work

The Company has also organized activities to promote employee engagement, such as:

- Senior executives highlighting the importance of employees in the monthly magazine
- Organizing events for different occasions

For senior employees, the Company has organized Mentor Training courses for two consecutive years to enable knowledge sharing between senior and new employees. Retired employees are also encouraged to continue working as consultants, facilitating knowledge transfer.

ThaiBev values family life by organizing activities like Kids’ Day to strengthen employee-family relationships. Activities include sermons by monks in the morning and field trips in the afternoon.

Moreover, ThaiBev has been providing scholarships to employees' children for eight years. In 2017, 1,123 scholarships totaling 6.9 million Baht were awarded. Since 2010, 8,169 scholarships have been provided, totaling 50,538,000 Baht.

# Employee Engagement and Well-being

To promote engagement, the Company has created over 10 clubs, offering opportunities for employees to participate in activities during their free time based on their skills and interests. These clubs include a health club, bicycle club, photography club, bowling club, and football club. The Company also encourages the use of exercise facilities and fitness centers, with 9 fitness centers and over 73 sport grounds available. Additionally, the Company focuses on employee mental health by providing information on stress management through magazines and the internal website, as well as activities to foster work-life balance.

![Health Activities Increase](#)

**The number of employees attending ThaiBev’s health activities has increased by 6.7% in 2017 compared with 2016.**

# Human and Labor Rights

ThaiBev treats its employees with respect and in a non-discriminatory manner, adhering to its human rights policy adopted in 2016 to avoid all forms of human rights infringements. The policy ensures no discrimination based on gender, religion, or other differences, covering all activities in the Company and relevant stakeholders.

In 2017, a human rights risk self-assessment, including risk mapping and risk assessment, was conducted across all operations in Thailand for four areas of the business value chain: procurement and supply chain, production, marketing and sales, and distribution. This assessment covered all stakeholder groups, including children, indigenous people, migrant labor, third-party contracted labor, local communities, and the disabled.

ThaiBev has developed a tool for evaluating human rights risks across its business groups at the practitioner level, monitoring risks in production, sales, and procurement processes.

## Identified Risks

The assessment identified risks in four aspects of the business value chain:

- **Production:** Risks related to employee occupational health from work injuries or community health from alcohol distillation processes.
- **Procurement and Supply Chain:** Risks concerning contractors' occupational health.
- **Distribution:** Risks of child labor by ThaiBev’s partners or road safety in Company transportation.
- **Marketing and Sales:** Risks of selling alcohol to underage individuals, with ongoing preventive measures.

Moreover, the Company fosters a good work environment and equal opportunities, promoting equality among staff. Female staff constitute 32% of potential successors for key positions.

ThaiBev complies with labor law, establishing welfare committees in all subsidiaries with representatives from both employee and company sides. These committees discuss welfare and labor rights to enhance relations and understanding, and provide encouragement to employees. The Company also trains committee members on communication processes through peaceful consultation and agreement.

# Safety, Occupational Health and Work Environment

Safety, occupational health and work environment of employees is an important foundation in advancing the organization in a stable and sustainable manner.

ThaiBev requires that safety management in each process is in accordance with the standards for safety, occupational health and work environment required by law and conforming to international standards. This is to ensure that its employees and contractors are taken care of at the highest level in terms of safety. A positive work environment and work-life balance are also maintained according to ThaiBev’s occupational health and safety policy.

# Safety Culture

![Safety Pyramid](safety_pyramid.png)

- **Fatally**
- **Permanent Total Disabilities**
- **Lost Times**
- **Restricted Workday**
- **Medical Treatment**
- **First Aid**
- **Near Miss**

ThaiBev aspires to create a safety culture throughout the organization. The executives provide leadership and give examples of safety to employees of all levels, and encourage the sharing of case studies, best practices on safety and involvement of employees and relevant stakeholders.

In 2017, the Company created a safety manual to guide employees and contractors on basic practices in working together with ThaiBev. The compilation of safety information covers all aspects of the Company’s activities in detail. Trainings and knowledge sharing on best practices have also taken place for employees. Trainings, specifically for safety personnel, have been organized to create an understanding of the law relating to safety and how to reduce accidents at work. There have also been training on emergency management, an exhibition week on work safety, and a dialogue on safety.

Moreover, ThaiBev has organized trainings for individuals on the committees on safety, occupational health and work environment to guide them on the operation and solving problems related to safety workplace in accordance with national standards and laws.

To promote safety culture, ThaiBev creates a channel for communication and knowledge and experience sharing within the organization. In 2017, the Company developed the ThaiBev Safety Community under the SAP JAM system as a channel for the employees to share and discuss the topics relating to safety, risks and how to resolve issues.

# Safety, Occupational Health and Work Environment

In 2017, ThaiBev organized trainings on safety for 5,714 employees at the practitioner level, which is equal to 17% of all practitioners. The Company spent over 1.7 million Baht in developing employees’ knowledge on safety.

ThaiBev organized the following activities to improve work safety in 2017.

## Finding “Near Miss”

The Company encourages its employees and contractors to identify circumstances or behavior that are prone to accidents in the factory or “Near Miss” in understanding of possible risks and provide suggestions for resolving them, as well as to report any unsafe acts or conditions in the factory.

Moreover, the Company encourages its employees and contractors to learn from their experiences to build awareness on safety by having them report any unsafe acts or conditions in the factory directly to the agency responsible for safety. This helps the factory see the overall situation of safety risks more clearly in order to put in place appropriate preventative measures.

## Program to Lower Accidents in Factory

The Company initiated a program to decrease the number of accidents by aiming to reduce injuries that resulted in suspension of work the previous year. This is used as a safety indicator for the practitioners so that every factory takes employees’ safety seriously.

In addition to measuring the brightness, noise, air quality, humidity, and temperature so that they comply with the legal standards, ThaiBev also promotes the health of its employees by providing health check-ups and influenza vaccinations every year.

# Energy and Climate Change

**ThaiBev cares about the impact its business operations exert on climate change.** It is one of the challenges which will spark solutions that simultaneously help improve the Company and preserve the environment to remain in a stable and sustainable condition.

Climate change is another natural disaster that is intensifying by the day. Not only is it an issue close to home, it is a phenomenon that every country in the world needs to pay attention to and adapt according to the changing environment.

To keep pace with the Twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021) which adheres to the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN as a framework for national development, climate change is one of the important issues that ThaiBev cares about. This is because climate change exerts a direct impact on ThaiBev’s business operations. For example, water shortages in the dry season result in lessened yield of agricultural products, which can impact input costs, and problems might multiply if the Company does not have a good management strategy.

With determination and a clear intention to conduct business aggressively, combined with the desire to take part in climate change management, ThaiBev has initiated management of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to reduce environmental impact, save energy, and promote making the most of energy used via various projects. These include using alternative and renewable energy in the manufacturing process, modifying electrical equipment, or developing innovations to enhance energy efficiency of machinery, and so on.



**GRI Standards:**

- GRI 103-1, GRI 103-2, GRI 302-1, GRI 302-3, GRI 302-4, GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4, GRI 305-5

# Enhancing Energy Efficiency

## Use of Renewable Energy

As ThaiBev prioritizes the use of renewable energy, it has conducted research on alternative energy sources. The company has increased its use of alternative fuels by utilizing by-products of the manufacturing process as fuel for further production. Examples of such by-products include biogas, distillery slop, and technical alcohol. Additionally, the company has initiated projects to harness solar energy in steam production.

In 2017, 18% of all energy used by the company was renewable.

The company focuses on and promotes the continual use of renewable energy. It has installed biogas production facilities at 5 distilleries and invested in constructing a renewable energy plant processing distillery slop in Kanchanaburi Province, with a budget of 798 million baht. The biomass energy renewed will be used in distilleries in two parts: the first as heat energy applied in distilleries, and the remaining part will be used to produce electricity to be sold to the Provincial Electricity Authority, a multi-use process called a cogeneration system. The renewable energy plant is under construction, expected to be completed by the end of 2017, and will start producing and selling electricity by March 2018. This program is a pilot project that may expand to include other factories in the ThaiBev network with the potential to turn biomass into fuel for further production, promoting the use of alternative energy.

## Steam and Electricity Generation from Biomass Fuel

- **Spirits Production** 
  - Vinasse → Evaporation Process → Concentrated Slop (biomass fuel) → Incineration Process → High-Pressure Steam
  - Steam → Steam Turbine → Electricity → Provincial Electricity Authority

# Carbon Footprint

For greenhouse gas management to be sustainable, ThaiBev has implemented the Carbon Footprint Assessment Program, of interest to the Company's stakeholders. It has expanded the scope of the companies in the ThaiBev Group receiving carbon footprint certification for both Carbon Footprint for Organization and Carbon Footprint of Product. At present, 18 companies in ThaiBev Group have received Carbon Footprint for Organization certification while 40 products that have received Carbon Footprint of Product certification from Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO). In addition, the Company has certified Carbon Footprint Reduction labels on 6 products. For products to be certified, they must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by no less than 2 percent compared to the base year.

Reduction of GHG emissions by no less than **2%** compared to the base year.

# The Reduction of Transportation-Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions

As the distribution of goods is a step in ThaiBev’s value chain that receives equal attention to production, efficient use of energy during distribution is emphasized. The Company has developed the Transportation Order Management System (TOMS) application, for use in controlling and tracking driving behavior of delivery employees, to ensure the delivery of goods via the specified route in time with appointments set with customers and to help increase delivery efficiency resulting from good planning. In addition, the use of TOMS helps to manage vehicle return (backhauling) which has resulted in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition, ThaiBev has focused on its impact on the environment and surrounding communities, including efficient energy use. The Company has invested more than 400 million baht in changing more than 100 delivery vehicles, using state of the art delivery technology, paired with development of the mindset of delivery drivers, following the principles of “4 Disciplines of Execution”:
- Discipline 1 – Focus on the Wildly Important;
- Discipline 2 – Act on the Lead Measures;
- Discipline 3 – Keep a Compelling Scoreboard;
- Discipline 4 – Create a Cadence of Accountability.

Using this construct allows employees to set goals and follow guidelines to reduce fuel consumption and increase driving efficiency with clear results. For example, six-wheeled delivery trucks had an original driving performance of 5.5 kilometers per liter of fuel, but within just 18 months, they have increased efficiency to 6.7 kilometers per liter of fuel, or a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 1,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

# ThaiBev's Cooling Equipment

In the sale of beverage products, coolers are regarded as one of the most important pieces of equipment for giving consumers refreshment, quenching of thirst, and satisfaction with goods and services. They also help partners and customers of the Company reach consumers better. At present, the Company has more than 85,000 coolers in distribution. The Company has plans to change from refrigerant R12 to refrigerant R134a, which is not an ozone depleting substance (ODS) and also emits less greenhouse gas than the former refrigerant. This can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 13,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

| ODS-free | Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 13,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year |

# Air Quality Control

To take care of surrounding communities concerned about the pollution that may be caused by the manufacturing process, ThaiBev has implemented appropriate technology for air quality control using the universally recognized air quality control standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). At the same time, ThaiBev complies with the Ministry of Industry’s 2006 Announcement Determining the Acceptable Quantity of Air Contaminants Released from Factories. Particulate pollution is continually measured in total suspended particulates (TSP), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Technology is used to control and manage potential pollution. For example: the installation of cyclone dedusters, the installation of wet scrubbers, and the installation of bag filters. As a result, the quality of air released into the atmosphere is better than the legal requirements.

# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

In 2017, ThaiBev achieved a 4.53% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per hectoliter of product compared to the base year of 2014. This reduction demonstrates effective management of greenhouse gas emissions through various activities, including employee participation in reducing environmental impact. The company expanded its business and reporting scope to include distribution operations and direct emissions of greenhouse gases (Scope 1) from biogenic activities. As a result, overall greenhouse gas emissions increased to 7.27 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectoliter or 47.73%.

1. **Global Water Tool** developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) for locating at-risk factories in terms of water shortages or poor water quality.
2. **Water Resource Review** to keep an account of water consumption amount and water quality in each source related to the Company.
3. A tool of the Enterprise Risk Management framework to assess water quantity and quality's risk and impact on business operations, as well as the impact of water consumption by the Company on stakeholders.

The Company analyzes all the information, the results of which factor in decision making concerning water management.

In order to reduce adverse effects from water issues, the Company is planning to invest in a water reserve system so that both factories and stakeholders living around factory areas may be able to use water in a reliable and sustainable manner.

# Water Consumption Efficiency

Careful consumption of natural resources is one of the ways ThaiBev expresses its responsibility. To that end, the Company foregrounds the following approaches to achieving efficiency in water management:

- Appropriate water consumption from each water source, so as to reduce adverse effects on the community.

| Water Source      | Percentage |
|-------------------|------------|
| Surface Water     | 74.75%     |
| Ground Water      | 15.67%     |
| Municipal Water   | 8.54%      |
| Rain Water        | 1.04%      |

**Total Water Consumption: 24.84 Million Cubic Meters**

# Water Stewardship

- **Total Productive Maintenance (TPM):** Involves everyone in maintaining machinery and equipment to be in maximally ready condition, reducing waste in water and energy consumption in the production system.
- **3Rs Principle:** Increase production efficiency by reducing, reusing, and recycling consumed water. In 2017, 8.85% of water consumed was reused and recycled.

## 3Rs

### Reduce
- Reduction of waste through leakage in the piping systems
- Reduction of water consumption in the cleaning process of fermentation tanks
- Increasing water consumption efficiency in the production of steam in the distilling process

### Reuse
- **4.44%**
  - Reusing condensation as boiler feed water to reduce water consumption and heat energy
  - Reusing water from the water treatment process for in-factory use to reduce regular water usage

### Recycle
- **4.41%**
  - Recycling treated wastewater for use as plant watering

- Measure the water footprint from both direct and indirect consumption to improve and develop water consumption efficiency.

As a result of more efficient water consumption, the company achieved a reduction of 0.22 hectoliters of groundwater and 0.16 hectoliters of municipal water per hectoliter of finished goods, a reduction of 14.48% and 19.86% compared to 2014.

## Water Intensity (Beverage Business)

# ThaiBev Awards and Effluents Quality Control

## ThaiBev has received multiple awards for the project

"Modeling and Expanding the Network of Efficient Groundwater Resource Management in the Industrial Sector through Social Tools" from the Water Institute for Sustainability of the Federation of Thai Industries. The awards evidence the Company's determination in moving forward with efficient water resource management, reduction in water consumption in the manufacturing process, and strong management in stakeholders' network.

## Effluents Quality Control

ThaiBev has a wastewater treatment system, each of which is appropriately designed for a particular business. The Company controls wastewater quality to comply with the Ministry of Industry's 2017 announcement about "Control Standard of Factory Effluents 2017", as well as in accordance with the international standard of environmental management (ISO 14001). As a consequence, in the year 2017, 43% of factories did not release treated wastewater to public water sources, while the remaining factories ensured that their wastewater was treated to the point of reaching a level of quality higher than legally required before being released into water sources. These factories also routinely submit quality measurement reports to the Department of Industrial Works through both an online system and hard-copy documents.



# Commitment

ThaiBev is determined to manage waste with efficiency and in strict compliance with laws and regulations.

# Waste Management and Uses of Waste

**Waste prevention** is the best way to manage waste. ThaiBev is mindful about ingredient selection and resource consumption in the manufacturing process, from product design to post-consumption packaging management.

In the production of beverage and food products, ThaiBev brings natural raw ingredients through intricate processing steps to ensure that the consumer receives high-quality merchandise. These processing steps may produce waste that affects the environment and the community. Therefore, the Company is determined to set up a waste management system with maximum efficiency, choosing waste treatment or elimination methods following international standards and in compliance with the laws and regulations.

ThaiBev implements a "circular economy" framework in its operations, as follows:

- **Factories**
  - Engaging Employees in Waste Reduction
  - Waste Management
  - Responsible Waste Disposal

- **Agriculture**
- **Livestock**
- **Waste-to-Energy**
- **Waste Value-Added Activities**
- **Consumers**
- **Post-Consumption Packaging Management**

[Infographic: Circular Economy Process]

# Packaging Design and Post-Consumption Packaging Management

Waste prevention is the best way to manage waste. ThaiBev is mindful about ingredient selection and resource consumption in the manufacturing process, from product design to post-consumption packaging management. This is evidenced, for instance, in the design of drinking water bottles that contain less plastic and in its practice of reusing glass bottles and corrugated carton partitions in the beverage manufacturing process, among other areas. In order to show the determination to achieve the above objective of waste management, the Company has set progressively increasing goals for packaging.

## Reduce

The Company has successfully reduced resource consumption by 831,124 metric tons.

| Material | Metric Tons |
|----------|-------------|
| Plastic  | 1,610       |
| Glass    | 797,485     |
| Paper    | 32,029      |

# Engaging Employees in Waste Reduction

ThaiBev uses the frameworks "Total Quality Management" (TQM) and "Total Productive Maintenance" (TPM) wherein everyone takes part in management and equipment maintenance, respectively, as main tools in the manufacturing process. These tools not only add business value by maximizing resource consumption efficiency, but also reduce manufacturing costs and increase customer satisfaction.

Beer Thai (1991) Public Company Limited, the first brewery in Thailand and in Southeast Asia, recently received the award "TPM Excellence, Category A" from the TPM Awards Ceremony 2016, held by the Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance (JIPM). The Company has observed the 8 core TPM principles of maximizing efficiency and minimizing loss in the manufacturing process through problem analysis tools, good maintenance practice, education and training, among others. As a consequence, there was a reduction in waste from the manufacturing process and an increase in resource consumption efficiency. This award serves as a good certification for the quality of ThaiBev’s waste management.

# An Example of Engaging Employees in Waste Reduction in the Food Business Group

The best way to manage waste is to prevent waste from being produced in the first place. The Oishi Company, a food business under ThaiBev Group, has encouraged staff participation in waste reduction, wherein employees jointly find ways to maximize the use of all parts of a salmon as the main ingredient in developing food items, in order to reduce food waste. As a result, staff came up with 12 salmon dishes, efficiently using all parts, no matter if the dish is sushi, sashimi, temaki, teppanyaki, or fried salmon skin, among others. Apart from waste reduction, this initiative also boosted diversity in the menu, attracting more consumers. The Company has even used salmon bones as ingredients in soup to reduce food waste.

# Waste Value-Added Activities

ThaiBev recognizes the opportunity of turning waste or "by-products" into valuable products which may be variously used as raw materials in the agricultural and industrial sectors. On top of adding social value and reducing environmental impact, the Company has continuously done research and development in partnership with both the government and leading universities in the country, so as to maximize the benefits. For instance, malt residue and grain residue, remainders from alcohol production, contain nutrients and nutritional value and so will be used as ingredients in livestock feed. For another example, vinasse that comes out of the distilling process may be used as a soil-conditioner in the growing of sugarcane, rice, cassava, and oil palm, among others. These examples illustrate how waste can become starting ingredients in a circular economy; this also lends support to chemical reduction, which in turn fosters sustainability in the agricultural sector.

ThaiBev has continuously done research and development in partnership with both the government and leading universities in the country. The most recent of research projects is "Lightweight aggregate," an open innovation in collaboration with the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA).

Lightweight aggregate, grain-like synthetic material made from the process of incinerating industrial waste, with the intention of obtaining strength equal to that of ceramics with numerous pores inside (>70% air pores). It is a raw material that can be put in a concrete mix for use in construction in the form of pre-made paving blocks, lightweight blocks, and precast concrete. Lightweight aggregate has high strength and low density, resulting in its light weight, its status as insulator against heat and coldness, and its good sound absorption. It is expected that Lightweight aggregate will be manufactured and sold starting in April 2018.

# Waste-to-Energy

ThaiBev has continuously done research and development to add value to manufacturing waste and use it to generate energy. For instance, vinasse, a waste by-product from the spirit distilling process, and wastewater from the beer brewing process, are used to produce biogas. Furthermore, vinasse has been used to produce biomass fuel in the form of concentrated vinasse, which may replace fossil fuel in steam generation used in manufacturing. The Company has turned waste into alternative energy sources for producing 24.84 million liters in total, or 278 million baht in the year 2017. The aforementioned procedure supports the use of renewable energy, reduces emission, and reduces production costs. Moreover, a new company power plant is under construction, generating electricity from biomass fuel developed from vinasse. This is an efficient way of turning waste into energy.

# Responsible Waste Disposal

Even with preventive measures minimizing waste generation and waste-to-landfill, it is impossible to avoid waste generation from manufacturing for the sake of quality and safety for the consumer. Therefore, correct and legal methods of waste treatment or elimination are observed in the Company's rules, so that its business operations are accountable to the community, society, and environment.

As a result of efficient waste management in the manufacturing process, the Company in 2017 has generated total waste of 63,681 metric tons. The waste intensity (kilogram per hectoliter of finished goods), meanwhile, has decreased by 43 percent compared to the year 2014 as a base year. The details are as follows.

## Waste Intensity (Beverage Business)

| Year | By-Product Waste | Valuable Waste | General Waste | Hazardous Waste | Total |
|------|------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|

# Key Highlights: 2017

## Model Youth of Bang Khu Wat Community Project

The Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, in collaboration with the Kenan Institute Asia, has organized the project for 3 consecutive years in the area surrounding the factories of Bang Yi Khan Liquors Company Limited. The purpose is to foster model youth who take leadership roles in the development of their own community. There are 3 groups of participants:

### Youth
Youth participants attend a Youth Camp, where they learn about management skills related to community development projects and then come up with their own projects. They also establish a Youth Club, integrated with school curriculum into a weekly gathering, to learn from one another and carry out community projects. Successful participants are called "model youth," having developed leadership through project-based learning.

### Community Leaders
Participants develop leadership skills through training workshops and visits to various communities to learn about different forms of community development. They also participate in community forum planning for development in Bang Khu Wat.

### Employees
Participating ThaiBev employees undergo a training workshop about community work and participate in activities organized by youth and community leaders.

In its three years of operation, the student-centered Bang Khu Wat community development project, with participation from all local sectors, has led to the creation of a local green area called "Lotus Pond Learning Center," a place for locals to learn about growing lotuses. Additionally, the "Foster a Lotus" activity involves 50 community members from all 12 subsections of Bang Khu Wat taking a lotus home to grow and care for, participating in subsequent lotus shows and contests.

## "Water Development, Life Development, Quality of Life Development" Project

Recognizing the value and importance of natural sources and the environment, ThaiBev is committed to community development projects in sustainable management of natural resources. Inspired by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who tirelessly worked for the benefit of society, the project is in cooperation with the Utokapat Foundation under Royal Patronage of H.M. The King. It helps conserve water and forest resources and supports sustainable local economic development through a three-step process.

### Three-Step Process

#### Understand
- Community members learn about local water sources and waterways to understand their water system and create a water supply map.

#### Reach Out
- Community members develop a local water management initiative, make a grant proposal, and hold a public meeting to gain community understanding. The Foundation provides recommendations to ensure maximum performance of the community's initiative.

#### Develop
- Community members execute the development initiative with participation from locals and newly trained youth groups to ensure long-term results and contribution.

The project organizes field trips for the target community to learn from a successful community. There are two target communities, as follows:

**Community 1:** Ban Pak Suat, Pha Saeng Subdistrict, Ta Khun District, Surat Thani Province. Recovery of upstream forests by an earth-and-stone dam, whose dimensions are 11 meters wide at the mouth, 3.5 meters wide on the side, 8.4 meters wide at the bottom, 1.3 meters high, and a displacement of 1,500 cubic meters of earth for the dam.

**Community 2:** Ban Wang Si Phrai, Dong Dueay Subdistrict, Kong Krai Lat District, Sukhothai Province. Recovery of a fish conservation area by digging out a 680 meter long canal. The earth dug out is no less than 16,000 cubic meters. A less wasteful system for water distribution, following King Bhumibol’s "New Theory" was also installed.

# ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold

"ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold" is a model project providing blankets to those affected by harsh winters in the North and the Northeast, through caravans that give out 200,000 blankets annually. Through collaboration with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation under the Ministry of Interior and Province Chiefs, affected areas are identified, points of distribution selected, and allied organizations called to help run the activities to cover all areas. Furthermore, this year ThaiBev emphasizes access to healthcare treatment through "mobile clinics" for public health check-ups, in cooperation with Suan Dok Hospital Foundation and the Ruam Paet Yasothon Hospital.

With ThaiBev’s resolution to give warmth to others in society, the "ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold" project, now in its 18th year, continues to build a sustainable, generous society. Having distributed 3.6 million blankets to date, the project has helped to create smiles of joy and good health for many Thai people, having covered 45 provinces, 579 districts, 4,622 subdistricts, 49,617 communities. In this past year, there was also an initiative "One Shares, Another Gets Warm," wherein employees and the Company’s partners may purchase additional blankets, on top of the usual two hundred thousand, to distribute to areas outside the 15 target provinces. As a result, 1,000 blankets have been given to cold-affected schoolchildren in Kanchanaburi Province.

# ThaiBev and the Pracharath Policy

The government has a policy of "Public-Private Collaboration," a systematic integration between the government and various sectors, geared toward the reduction of inequality, the development of human capital, and the increase in competitiveness. In this vein, the government has established a total of 12 working groups comprising:

1. Working Group for Innovation and Productivity Enhancement
2. Working Group for SMEs and Start-up Promotion
3. Working Group for Tourism and MICE Promotion
4. Working Group for Export and Outbound Investment Promotion
5. Working Group for S-Curve Industrial Clusters Development
6. Working Group for Modern Agriculture
7. Working Group for FDI and Infrastructure Development
8. Working Group for Workforce Quality Enhancement
9. Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy
10. Working Group for Law and Regulation Reform
11. Working Group for Basic Education and Leadership Development
12. Working Group for the Pracharath Policy for Society

The Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy (E3) is headed in the public sector team by General Anupong Paochinda, the Minister of Interior, and in the private sector team by Mr. Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, President and CEO of ThaiBev. The Working Group's primary goal is to generate income for the community, so that the people are happy. This happens through the "Pracharath" mechanism where 5 sectors synergize: the public sector, the private sector, the civil society sector, the academic sector, and the people. Jointly the sectors enhance the potential of local businesses from the beginning to the middle and end of their operations, with the goal of sustainable income in 3 categories, which are agriculture, processing, and community-based tourism.

The working group embraces the principles put forth by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of "Understand, Reach Out, Develop." This means that prior to the execution of a development project, there needs to be an understanding of locals and outreach to gauge their wants and needs, which will form the guidelines for resolving the problems at hand. This way, development will correspond to the needs of the people, resulting in their happiness and sufficient income to support their families, while at the same time enabling them to help others and society in a sustainable manner.

In its approach, the working group adheres to the principles of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. These principles, when combined with the "Pracharath" mechanism, characterized by cooperation between all sectors (that is, the public sector, the private sector, the civil society sector, the academic sector, and the people), can concretely bring society closer to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (SDGs). In addition, they can help push the development of Thailand toward a value-based economy under the Thailand 4.0 model. As the working group's leader from the private sector, ThaiBev has a high level of commitment to push the "Public-Private Collaboration" work forward to generate income and increase the happiness of local people in a stable and sustainable manner.

To propel the work forward with efficiency, concrete results and long-term viability, the Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy pushed for the establishment of "Social Enterprise" under the name "Pracharath Rak Samakee (The State and the People Love Harmony)" in every province and established PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Company Limited to be the central unit for coordination between various sectors throughout the country. The PRS Social Enterprise network has been fully established across the country since November 2016.

# National Level Projects

In addition, Thailand’s Ministry of Interior also organizes provincial committees for coordinating and driving public-private collaboration in order to support the work of collaborative projects at the provincial level. These provincial committees work with all local sectors, with the Province Governor at the core and with representatives from various provincial government units, such as development offices, agriculture offices, commerce offices, and tourism offices, among others, in collaboration with the private sector, the civil society sector, the academic sector, and the people in the province. Together, they propel the work and make use of the province’s PRS Company to help strengthen and support community businesses in the target communities.

As for the work at the local level to develop 3 groups of community businesses, namely agriculture, processing, and community-based tourism, the Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy has assigned PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Company Limited the work of implementing the “Collaboration for Our Hometowns” project in order to foster a new generation of community business developers in their twenties, so that they build their leadership skills, problem-solving skills, and a desire to develop their hometown. For 2 months, community business developers in training learn about community business management skills and area-specific community development, before being sent to do real work in their hometowns. Currently, there are two cohorts of community business developers, each with 76 trainees who have put their training to use in developing their home communities, in collaboration with various sectors in the province. Furthermore, these trainees help create understanding about the “public-private collaboration” approach among youth and people of the new generation.

Throughout the past year, all 76 provincial PRS Social Enterprise companies have already done more than 500 projects to develop community businesses throughout the country. These projects can be divided along 3 categories: agriculture (35%), processing (49%), and tourism (15%). The projects have generated income for 30,000 households in the network, totaling 58 million baht.

## 1. Thai Handicraft Pakaoma Project

The Thai Handicraft Pakaoma Project focuses on creating added value on 4 fronts, namely: the raising of awareness of and interest in hand-woven pakaoma in both domestic and foreign consumer groups; the proliferation of innovations in production and processing of hand-woven pakaoma in order to increase variety in usage; knowledge exchanges between communities and experts in various fields, on topics such as the use of natural dyes and packaging development; and lastly, the protection of the intellectual property rights of communities by copyrighted designs, trademarks, and patents. This project also holds various activities to achieve project goals, such as:

- Organizing a pakaoma contest with more than 500 participating communities nationwide
- A workshop for pakaoma weaving communities to introduce new techniques in production for adding value to pakaoma products
- Sponsoring the project to present 30 hand-woven Thai pakaoma outfits on an international fashion runway at Amazon Fashion Week TOKYO 2017, and organizing a contest for university students to design evening gowns made from pakaoma
- Coordinating the processes of copyrighting, trademarking, and patenting textile designs and petty patenting folding looms for 22 weaving communities
- Development of pakaoma products and making sales connections with large organizations such as ThaiBev, the Stock Exchange of Thailand, Tesco Lotus, etc.

Throughout the past year, this project was able to create income for more than 519 pakaoma-weaving communities in 49 provinces nationwide. The total value of the hand-woven pakaoma products sold amounts to 7,000,000 baht.

## 3. Hospital Food Safety Project

The Hospital Food Safety Project by PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Company Limited, in cooperation with various ministries and organizations, promotes safety in food production and consumption. The project involves:

- Using public hospitals as primary buyers of vegetables, fruits, and food products.
- Random testing of toxicity levels in food.

The project started in 16 province-level hospitals in 2017 and aims to cover all 780 district-level hospitals by 2018. It focuses on modifying farmers' production methods to reduce chemical use and promote organic farming.

## 4. PRS Lab Project

PRS Social Enterprise (Thailand) Company Limited signed a contract with Central Laboratory (Thailand) Co., Ltd. to support residue inspection and develop standards for agricultural goods, processed goods, food items, and cosmetics. The project includes:

- Training programs for producers.
- "PRS Lab" coupons for product quality inspection.

Currently, 18 province-level PRS companies participate, having delivered over 60 community products for inspection, valued at over 300,000 Baht. By the end of 2017, over 1,000 products are expected to be submitted for quality inspection, with a development value estimated at 5,000,000 Baht.

## Examples from the Agriculture Category

### 1. Lobster Restoration Project, Phuket Province

The Phuket Lobster Festival 2017 generated more than 24,000,000 Baht in income for the community during the low season. The number of Phuket hotels and restaurants participating in the project rose from 35 in 2016 to 200 in 2017. The PRS Social Enterprise (Phuket) Company Limited is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives to develop breeds and processes for raising lobsters more effectively and to promote community-based tourism in the farming areas.


# Organic Agriculture, Nakhon Pathom Province

The year 2017 is the national occasion for consuming fresh vegetables and safe fruits, due to the enforcement of Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) and the expansion of organic agriculture by the promotion of increased production and the use of appropriate technology. Dovetailing with the Hospital Food Safety project, local farmers sent their products to hospitals, safe agriculture markets, and expanded into the high-end market and health-focused restaurants. Vegetables and fruits weighing 9,677 kilograms in total were sent to hospitals, an estimated value of 424,464 baht. (Data from April to August 2017.)

## Examples from the Processing Category

1. **Batik Products**  
   Developing batik products in line with the needs of the batik market of Phuket Province and 10 southern provinces by adding batik onto other things like bags, and designing patterns that meet market demand. As well, the project connects and shares knowledge between the batik groups of 10 southern provinces through the organizing of Batik Design Week 2016 by which the batik groups of 10 southern provinces generated more than 1,900,000 baht in income. In 2017, connections were made between batik groups from 31 communities and the Hotels Association and the Tourist Business Association, in order to create sales channels for community products, resulting in a 24 million baht increase in revenue for communities.

2. **Pan Tong Fried Peanuts, Roi Et Province**  
   PRS Social Enterprise (Roi Et) Company Limited helped push Pan Tong Fried Peanuts to develop proper packaging for OTOP sales on aircraft. In addition, the Company helped expand peanut cultivation, expand group membership and increase production capacity to meet demand, while at the same time enhancing product quality to meet international standards.

## Examples from the Community-Based Tourism Category

1. **Rare Snacks Community along Khlong Nong Bua, Chanthaburi Province**  
   PRS Social Enterprise (Chanthaburi) Company Limited, in cooperation with the Office of Community Development of Chanthaburi Province, sponsors and pushes for an exhibition project and community market "Thais Helping Thais Is How Thais Can Smile." This project is aimed at raising the standards of the community market to be a model worthy of trust from the people, as well as creating opportunities for producers and small farmers with more sales channels. The Rare Snacks Community along Khlong Nong Bua is a historic community that has retained its identity for more than 100 years. Consisting of historic houses on both sides of the street, the community sells traditional foods and delicious traditional desserts that are hard to find nowadays. For example: kanom tit Rho (purple sticky rice dumplings) and hanom hua lan (mung bean dumplings), which have already become a selling point for tourists. Throughout the project’s first year, no less than 240,000 baht per month in income has been generated for the community.

2. **Dhamma Mileage Travel in Sap Si Thong, Chaiyaphum Province**  
   Sap Si Thong District is one of four districts located around Lanka Mountain, a place with natural beauty, ways of life worth studying, and a community with ancient cultural traditions. It also has places for meditation, which are the heart and soul of the community. Therefore, the Working Group has sponsored and pushed for Sap Si Thong to become a Chaiyaphum tourist attraction through promotional activities and connections with various parties. The generated income from promoting community-based tourism in Sap Si Thong District, together with the sale of agricultural products in the area, equals an increase in revenue of 50,000 baht each month.

3. **King Cobra Village Tourism, Baan Khok Sa-nga, Khon Kaen Province**  
   The PRS Social Enterprise (Khon Kaen) Company Limited and Office of Community Development Khon Kaen province organized a community forum on sustainable development for the management group of the King Cobra Village community. At present, the forum has enabled the King Cobra Village to establish a show and to collect admission tickets with the following prices: adults 40 baht, children 20 baht, and foreigners 100 baht, ensuring regular income per month for the group. Revenue has increased by almost 8 times per visiting tourist. In addition, this led to the renovation of the entryway to the site, an online webpage for the group, connections to handicraft groups close to the village who were brought in to produce souvenirs, and other internal administrative arrangements. Income generated for the community totaled more than 290,000 baht.

### Comparison of Revenue from Sale of King Cobra Show Tickets (in baht)

| Year | July     | August   | September |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 2016 | 66,614   | 57,254   | 47,967    |
| 2017 | 112,180  | 103,500  | 76,373    |

In addition to the work in these three categories, the Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy (E3) and ThaiBev organized another project: One Tambon One Product Junior (OTOP Junior). A collaboration between the work of the Working Group for Local Economic Development and Pracharath Policy (E3) and the Working Group for Basic Education and Leadership Development (E5), OTOP Junior has the objective of improving learning achievements by a child-centered educational method and hands-on practice of occupational activities in line with the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. This elevates the OTOP Junior products from the children’s creativity into real value in the marketplace. By incorporating lessons about household bookkeeping and project accounting, the project hopes to build fiscal responsibility and generate an income for the children and their families, ultimately strengthening the foundations for developing quality of life and fostering resilience so that students grow up to be quality citizens and be of value to society.

# Education Development

Education is a foundation of sustainable development. ThaiBev is committed to building a society of collaborative learning through various projects and activities in the organization, in communities and at various educational institutions, consistent with the Quality Education goal of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## Scholarship Program

ThaiBev is not only committed to being a leading beverage producer but is also focused on the most important and fundamental issue, child and youth education, which is the first step toward personal development and the improvement of society and the country. For this reason, ThaiBev established a scholarship fund for children of employees in 2010, to promote and support educational advancement for children of employees who have good academic performance, as well as to help alleviate costs for their parents. The Company has offered the scholarship on two separate occasions: first, scholarships for primary education until high vocational certificate, given in August 2017; second, scholarships for university-level education and special-case scholarships (White Elephant Program), given in September 2017.

In 2017, the children of employees received 1,123 scholarships and 10 special scholarships from the White Elephant Program. From 2010 to this year, 8,169 scholarships have been granted, totaling 50,538,000 baht. In addition, since 2011, 21 awardees of the scholarship from the White Elephant Program or the general program have joined the ThaiBev workforce.

The Company will continue to be committed to sponsoring the education of children of employees, so that they grow into strong and dependable adults with a solid educational foundation.

## Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teachers Project

Is a project in which ThaiBev helps create occupational opportunities for remote communities, working together with teachers that have received the Princess of Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Teacher Prize granted by 3 agencies: the Office of Non-Formal and Informal Education, the Border Police Headquarters and the Office of the Basic Education Commission. Five years after the prize was first introduced in 2013, the project has initiated various activities that encompass aspects of quality of life and the environment. These activities raise awareness among community members about the importance of having an occupation that enables self-reliance as well as forest conservation. For example:

1. **Beekeeping to Preserve the Forest Project**: with ThaiBev’s support, the community creates honeycomb-like rectangular boxes, and then hangs or places them in the community forest area of around 2,000 rai, in order to lure in queen bees to come live and nest in the honeycomb box. The bees then produce honey when the time comes. Beekeeper groups have generated more income the past 2 years, while at the same time contributed to forest conservation as part of the conservation of watershed areas, which are a major water source in the country.

# 2. "Growing Coffee following the '3 Types of Forest, 4 Types of Use' Concept" Project

Because coffee is a plant that likes a cool environment, if planted under the shade of large trees, it will produce coffee with high quality, intense flavor, and more aroma than coffee planted in fields. Members of the community therefore gathered to plant Arabica coffee in 12 rai of community forest area and received coffee hulling machine from ThaiBev, in order to serve community members and increase the coffee’s value for them to earn more, as well as be part of the conservation of 2,000 rai of forest.

## Extra Courses for Careers with ThaiBev

A project where ThaiBev organizes various courses to meet the needs of remote communities. The "Extra Courses for Careers with ThaiBev" project is important for communities to have occupations and income and lays the foundation for real community stability. This results in the conservation of watershed forests, which are an important resource for natural water production for the country, and the building of cooperation with the government and communities and to make ThaiBev’s programs for society well known among community members. This project encompasses courses on cutting men and women’s hair, sewing courses, cooking and baking courses, motorcycle maintenance courses, and courses on recycling goods for use in household agriculture. The project selects communities that are appropriate, prepared, and have sufficient time and interest in the project. Workshops are arranged in remote communities to solve the problem of educational inequality and once the participants successfully finish the course, they are provided with necessary equipment and receive periodic follow-up.

# Project EISA

## EISA: Educational Instituted Support Activities

EISA is a program in which ThaiBev supports youth development, the foundation of the country, through various activities. The aim is to educate youth to be concurrently "smart" and "good" for society, so that they bring their knowledge to help develop society and communities, and serve as good models for the youth of subsequent generations. Our youth development activities consist of various projects, which include:

### Youth Development with Sports in Higher Education

ThaiBev has taken a role in sports development at the university level so youth can continue to have a place to compete in sports. It does so by supporting the organization of sport competitions in partnership with universities and by developing a sports curriculum. ThaiBev believes that extracurricular activities during university years are an important part of learning, prior to entering the workforce. University students receive sports skills development paired with positive experience and share opportunities with classmates and students from other universities.

# Knowledge Development for Good Future Entrepreneurs

In order to develop university students' skills as entrepreneurs, ThaiBev sponsors the creation of a model business enterprise, which has various courses for university students to learn store management, marketing, organizing various promotions, merchandising, stocking, accounting, and learning how to use the system Rich POS V7.0 for Retailers and Restaurants (F&B). It aims to build and disseminate knowledge about ethical management and professionalism, which university students can learn and apply in the future.

## Statistics

- **20,000** university students have participated in projects
- **200** projects in conjunction with universities
- **32** universities participating

## Creating the New Generation of Social Entrepreneurs Project (Beta Young Entrepreneur)

This is a project born from the collaboration of 3 organizations: the Thai Chamber of Commerce, the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, and the Sirivadhanabhakdi Foundation under Thai Beverage Public Company Limited. Together, the organizations are training a new generation of university students to enter the path of becoming entrepreneurs. The students must have potential, virtue, ethics, and social responsibility. University students will study entrepreneurship by trying out different practices such as from a 20,000 baht startup business, and a simulated business. This will be a starting point for their business. University students will have the opportunity to take their business plan forward to real entrepreneurship after graduation. The opportunity also promotes start-up projects for the new country generation to have opportunities to demonstrate their true potential. At present, 120 university students have completed the project.

*Funding to establish a business simulation totaling 1,000,000 baht*

## ARTTRAROS CREATIVE

An university student who participated in the 3rd cycle of the Creating the New Generation of Social Entrepreneurs project turned their plan into a real business: "From activities with ThaiBev, we learned that work requires careful planning and there must always be a backup plan, as well as emergency problem solving. The experience of teaming up together to do activities with ThaiBev made us realize what we like and what we are good at. When we do what we love, we will do it well." This brought us together to organize events and various activities under the name "ARTTRAROS CREATIVE."

# Involvement with ThaiBev

ThaiBev has had an opportunity to take part in student capacity building by bringing university students to participate in internships in various departments within the Company. This gives them a chance to learn from the direct experience of working in real conditions and being with others, so that this becomes the foundation of their future work. For example, university students have opportunities to visit and observe factories and warehouses of Oishi, TBL, and Big C.

- University students participate in our corporate social responsibility activities. For example: dam construction with the Taproot Project. In addition, university students also volunteer in temple-cleaning activities, the canal cleaning activity as part of the River Festival, ThaiBev Unites to Fight the Cold, and other activities, such as: A Good Community with a Smile, Model Youth of Bang Khu Wat, and so on.
- New graduates come to work in various parts of the Company.
- University students are one part of the pakaoma design team of the PRS working group handling the project "Local Pakaoma, Thai Handicraft."

The Company develops a curriculum in conjunction with universities, opening new courses for students interested in learning about topics like food service in cooperation with SO asean, promoting knowledge and skills in business and management through the experience of ThaiBev’s executives.

# Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of supporting public health, ensuring the health and well-being of members of society. Therefore, the Company is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations to promote the health and well-being of all. The Company accordingly supports various public health projects.

Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital is Asia’s leading specialized institute in the comprehensive treatment of kidney disease. From kidney disease screening and preventive healthcare for kidney damage, to hemodialysis, vascular bypass surgery, urinary surgery, and kidney transplants performed by specialized surgeons, together with state-of-the-art medical equipment and a standard of service equal to that of a private hospital with treatment costs not much higher than a public hospital.

Furthermore, the Institute forms part of the promotion and support of patient care, and the training and research of Thai nephrologists.

## Background

On the occasion of King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s diamond jubilee in June 2006, His Majesty the King christened the foundation that was to establish a hospital for treating kidney disease patients as well as doing research to find ways to disseminate knowledge about kidney disease prevention, as the Company recognizes the equal importance between prevention and treatment. The royal christening was an act of kindness immeasurably pivotal for Khun Charoen, Khunying Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi and the Sirivadhanabhakdi family, as it was the encouragement necessary for the successful establishment of the Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute. Furthermore, Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn is the chairperson of the Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute Hospital Foundation.

# Thai Long Boat Racing "One Focus, One Victory"

Our commitment to supporting Thai traditional sports for more than 30 years.

## Continuing the Thai long boat tradition, part of the cultural heritage of the Mekong

Long boat racing is both a cultural heritage of the river and a sport that reflects the village way of life and the relationship Thai people have had with water since the Ayutthaya period. Boats and the village way of life are part and parcel of the relationship between communities along the river basin and the life-sustaining river, a relationship in which villagers harmoniously take care of the river. This is consistent with ThaiBev’s approach to business, which is similarly dependent upon water, and is the origin of the concept “One Focus, One Victory.” The Company has lent its support to long boat racing for more than 30 years, including the long boat team “Mekong First Ship,” a team from the area surrounding a company factory.

## The Newest Generation of Long Boat Commentators Project

In the past year, ThaiBev initiated the “The Newest Generation of Long Boat Commentators” project, with the foresight that race commentators are an important element of long boat racing. They help add color and flavor into the event for the audience on both river banks, effectively the charm of the race. This profession should also be preserved and passed on to future generations. In addition, the project helps develop children who belong to these new generations. More than 10 Thai youth participants have qualified for further development into becoming professional commentators.

# Volleyball

## Success from Sustainable Development Guidelines

ThaiBev has been a sponsor of the Thai Volleyball Association for more than 30 years, making the association capable of systematically implementing a development plan for the continual success of volleyball players on the national and global level, as well as capable of winning the hearts of the people and pushing the new generation to become through-and-through professional volleyball players.

# Snooker

## SangSom 6 Red World Championship

ThaiBev sponsors and promotes snooker 6 red in Thailand, which has sparked a trend of popular interest and culminated in the SangSom 6 Red World Championship, which has been held for more than 10 years and boosted the 6 red snooker phenomenon in Thailand. Thai audiences can be proud of the snooker 6 red tournament, which has been proposed for inclusion at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. In addition, ThaiBev continues to support the world-class snooker players from Thailand, such as: Tong Sitchoi (James Wattana), formerly the third ranked snooker player in world, and Thepchaiya Un-Nooh (F Nakhon Nayok), World Champion of the SangSom 6 Red World Championship 2015.

# Castle 12 Race – a stage for local youth racers to maintain social order

“Castle 12” is a cooperative project between ThaiBev and Buriram Province which has operated for 3 years, to organize the space and set the rules for motorcycle speed races for youth racers for free. It aims to reduce the number of accidents and violent incidents among local youth, and to give youth knowledge about the rules and regulations of proper driving. Meanwhile, the project creates opportunities for learning about maintenance and how to compete in a professional manner, all with experienced professionals.

# Preserving and Promoting Arts and Culture

The promotion of arts and culture is one of ThaiBev's important missions. Throughout its existence, the Company has partnered with various organizations to support projects aimed at the preservation, continuation, and creation of national arts and culture, as well as activities pertaining to Thai religions and traditions. This is because ThaiBev recognizes the benefits of arts and culture for society, for the economy, for the community, and for future generations. At the same time, the Company hopes to grow artistic skills in Thailand to garner global recognition, and to boost sustainable national development as well.

Furthermore, in accord with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of quality education, ThaiBev supports youth having an equal chance to pursue various branches of arts and culture, outside of textbooks and classrooms as appropriate.

# Projects and Activities for Sustainable National Development

# Projects Supporting Education for Children and Youth

ThaiBev recognizes the importance of knowledge development through artistic creation of all kinds, with the belief that unfettered learning brings about endless imagination, which in turn leads to innovations for the future.

# Support for the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre (BACC) Foundation

ThaiBev supports the BACC in its projects and activities campaigning for increased knowledge and enthusiasm about art among the public. Furthermore, the BACC also creates educational initiatives, forums for discussion and exchange between artists and the public, and art education activities outside the classroom for youth and the general public. All these lead to an instilment of a "creative economy" revolving around commercial art making.

Examples of BACC’s activities include: Children’s Day “art activities @ bacc,” BACC Art Camp, educational activities accompanying exhibitions, kids’ storytelling and crafts, Art Talk events, guided tours of exhibitions, and training workshops for art teachers. In total, there have been about 10,000 youth participants in educational activities throughout 2017.

# Activities Supporting the Preservation of National Traditions, Cultures, and Local Ways of Life

All traditions, cultures, and ways of life arise from the roots of each community, and each region, with differences in philosophies, beliefs, and values. The result is a landscape of diverse communities, each with its own distinctive features, which may be utilized as strengths and “selling points” to elevate the local economy and to push for its growth. Since ThaiBev recognizes the opportunities to implement measures to impact local economic growth, the following cultural tourism activities have been organized:

- **Water Festival 2017: Waterways and Thai ways** in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Culture, the Navy, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the Tourism Authority of Thailand, and other allies. The festival aims to reassert the sharing of Thainess to the world, and to encourage young people to join in the learning, preservation, and sharing of history. Expanded to cover all four regions of Thailand, the festival allows tourists to experience authentic traditional Thai culture. All four sites feature numerous activities, including Family Day water ceremonies, auspicious merit-making ceremonies through sacred objects and temple visits, community (House + Temple + School) cleaning activities, “young hosts preserving culture” activities, “One Shot Knockout” activities, cooking competitions, a city-by-city menu, and visits to community grocery stores by Pracharat Rak Samakkee Social Enterprise Company.

- **River Festival: Streams of Culture** in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Sports and other allies. Sharing Thainess with the whole world, this festival boosts Thailand’s tourism industry, and invites both domestic and foreign tourists to experience the cultures of Thailand.

# Notes

- N/A: Not Applicable
- Numerical data from 2014-2016 has been updated from the Sustainability Report 2016 because ThaiBev improved the factors regarding energy and CO₂ emission to meet the current value. This was according to the accepted universal standard, method, and hypothesis.
- In 2014 - 2016, ThaiBev reported the efficiency of its environmental performance that covers a 12-month period.
- In 2016, ThaiBev reported the efficiency of its environmental performance which are divided into 2 parts as follows:
  1. The first part covered a period of 9 months from January – September 2016.
  2. The second part covers a period of 12 months from October 2015 – September 2016 in which the information in this part was collected from ThaiBev but was not evaluated by external verifier (Independent Limited Assurance).
- In 2017, ThaiBev reported the efficiency of its environmental performance that covers a period of 12 months from October 2016 – September 2017.
  1. Numerical data about environment in terms of food companies which is Oishi Trading Co., Ltd. (Ban Beung).
  2. Numerical data about environment in terms of non-alcoholic beverages which is S.P.M. Food and Beverage Co., Ltd.
  3. Numerical number about environment in terms of Supply Chain business unit such as Thai Beverage Energy Co., Ltd. and Thai Beverage Logistics Co., Ltd.
- Expanding reporting scope covers food business.
- Expanding reporting scope of direct GHG emission (Scope 1) which is emissions from biogenic activities in 2017.
- The emission factors of Benzene, Diesel, and LPG are not yet separated according to types of combustion (mobile and stationary); therefore, the higher values of emission factors are used for calculation.
- Change reporting units of emission intensity from metric ton CO₂ equivalent per hectoliter to Kilograms.
- Effluents quality reported in average values.
- Waste disposal is classified by types of waste from the manufacturing process, consisting of the following 4 types:
  1. General waste – disposed of by local authorities, such as the municipality or sub-district administration organization.
  2. Hazardous waste – disposed of by legally licensed companies.
  3. By-product waste – handled by Feed Addition Co., Ltd. one of ThaiBev’s subsidiaries to generate income for the Company.
  4. Valuable waste – sorted so that it can be reused and recycled.

    - GRI 306-1 Water discharge by quality and destination
  - **Social:**
    - GRI 403-2 Types of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, absenteeism and number of work-related fatalities
    - GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee
    - GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews
    - GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs.

Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of ThaiBev’s operations and activities outside of Thailand.

LRQA’s responsibility is only to ThaiBev. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. ThaiBev’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of ThaiBev.

### LRQA’s Opinion

Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that ThaiBev has not:

- Met the requirements above
- Disclosed reliable performance data and information for the selected topic specific standards
- Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report.

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the Verifier.

*Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.*

### LRQA’s Approach

LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with LRQA’s Report Verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:

- Reviewing ThaiBev’s approach to stakeholder engagement and determining material issues to confirm that this information had been used to prepare their Report. We did this by comparing reports written by ThaiBev’s peers to establish whether the majority of sector issues were included in this Report.

# Lloyd's Register LRQA

- **Checking** whether ThaiBev had followed GRI’s Universal Standard for disclosing their Governance Structure. This was confirmed by ensuring that the duty for sustainable development was part of ThaiBev’s senior management’s responsibility.
- **Auditing** ThaiBev’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions, or misstatements in the Report. This involved reviewing the effectiveness of data handling processes and systems. Discussions were held with key personnel in various facilities responsible for compiling the data and drafting the Report.
- **Sampling of evidence** presented at:
  - Non-alcoholic beverage plant (Oishi Trading Co., Ltd., Navanakorn, Pathum Thani)
  - Spirits plant (Sura Bangyikhan Co., Ltd., Pathum Thani)
  - Beer plant (Beer Thip Brewery (1991) Co., Ltd., Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya)
  
  This was to confirm the reliability of the topic-specific standards.

  **Note:** LRQA did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations.

## Observations

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:

- **Inclusivity:**
  - No key stakeholder groups have been excluded from ThaiBev’s stakeholder engagement process.

- **Materiality:**
  - ThaiBev has processes for identifying and determining material issues; the evaluation process considers factors such as stakeholder concerns, business risks, and legal compliance. No major material issues were excluded. Future reports should address other evolving issues such as circular economy, food waste, natural resource stewardship, Occupational Health and Safety.

- **Responsiveness:**
  - ThaiBev and its subsidiaries have processes for responding to various stakeholder groups. It is recommended that ThaiBev expand its campaigns with stakeholders to further public awareness about the effects of alcohol.

- **Reliability:**
  - ThaiBev uses spreadsheets and a manual system to collect and calculate data and information associated with the selected specific standard disclosures. ThaiBev should internally verify its data management systems to improve data reliability and ensure consistent reporting methodologies across all operations, for example, water discharge.

## LRQA’s Competence and Independence

LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training, and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent.

This verification is the only work undertaken by LRQA for ThaiBev and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
